Title: Efficient Replication of Queued Tasks for Latency Reduction in Cloud  Systems
Abstract: In cloud computing systems, assigning a job to multiple servers and waiting
for the earliest copy to finish is an effective method to combat the
variability in response time of individual servers. Although adding redundant
replicas always reduces service time, the total computing time spent per job
may be higher, thus increasing waiting time in queue. The total time spent per
job is also proportional to the cost of computing resources. We analyze how
different redundancy strategies, for eg. number of replicas, and the time when
they are issued and canceled, affect the latency and computing cost. We get the
insight that the log-concavity of the service time distribution is a key factor
in determining whether adding redundancy reduces latency and cost. If the
service distribution is log-convex, then adding maximum redundancy reduces both
latency and cost. And if it is log-concave, then having fewer replicas and
canceling the redundant requests early is more effective.
