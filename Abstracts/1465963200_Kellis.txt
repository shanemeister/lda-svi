Title: Network Maximal Correlation
Abstract: We introduce Network Maximal Correlation (NMC) as a multivariate measure of
nonlinear association among random variables. NMC is defined via an
optimization that infers transformations of variables by maximizing aggregate
inner products between transformed variables. For finite discrete and jointly
Gaussian random variables, we characterize a solution of the NMC optimization
using basis expansion of functions over appropriate basis functions. For finite
discrete variables, we propose an algorithm based on alternating conditional
expectation to determine NMC. Moreover we propose a distributed algorithm to
compute an approximation of NMC for large and dense graphs using graph
partitioning. For finite discrete variables, we show that the probability of
discrepancy greater than any given level between NMC and NMC computed using
empirical distributions decays exponentially fast as the sample size grows. For
jointly Gaussian variables, we show that under some conditions the NMC
optimization is an instance of the Max-Cut problem. We then illustrate an
application of NMC in inference of graphical model for bijective functions of
jointly Gaussian variables. Finally, we show NMC's utility in a data
application of learning nonlinear dependencies among genes in a cancer dataset.
