Title: ARBAC Policy for a Large Multi-National Bank
Abstract: Administrative role-based access control (ARBAC) is the first comprehensive
administrative model proposed for role-based access control (RBAC). ARBAC has
several features for designing highly expressive policies, but current work has
not highlighted the utility of these expressive policies. In this report, we
present a case study of designing an ARBAC policy for a bank comprising 18
branches. Using this case study we provide an assessment about the features of
ARBAC that are likely to be used in realistic policies.
