Title: Communication Theoretic Data Analytics
Abstract: Widespread use of the Internet and social networks invokes the generation of
big data, which is proving to be useful in a number of applications. To deal
with explosively growing amounts of data, data analytics has emerged as a
critical technology related to computing, signal processing, and information
networking. In this paper, a formalism is considered in which data is modeled
as a generalized social network and communication theory and information theory
are thereby extended to data analytics. First, the creation of an equalizer to
optimize information transfer between two data variables is considered, and
financial data is used to demonstrate the advantages. Then, an information
coupling approach based on information geometry is applied for dimensionality
reduction, with a pattern recognition example to illustrate the effectiveness.
These initial trials suggest the potential of communication theoretic data
analytics for a wide range of applications.
