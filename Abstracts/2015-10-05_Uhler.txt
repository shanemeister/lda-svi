Title: Total positivity in Markov structures
Abstract: We discuss properties of distributions that are multivariate totally positive
of order two (MTP2) related to conditional independence. In particular, we show
that any independence model generated by an MTP2 distribution is a
compositional semigraphoid which is upward-stable and singleton-transitive. In
addition, we prove that any MTP2 distribution satisfying an appropriate support
condition is faithful to its concentration graph. Finally, we analyze
factorization properties of MTP2 distributions and discuss ways of constructing
MTP2 distributions; in particular we give conditions on the log-linear
parameters of a discrete distribution which ensure MTP2 and characterize
conditional Gaussian distributions which satisfy MTP2.
