Title: Volatility of Power Grids under Real-Time Pricing
Abstract: The paper proposes a framework for modeling and analysis of the dynamics of
supply, demand, and clearing prices in power system with real-time retail
pricing and information asymmetry. Real-time retail pricing is characterized by
passing on the real-time wholesale electricity prices to the end consumers, and
is shown to create a closed-loop feedback system between the physical layer and
the market layer of the power system. In the absence of a carefully designed
control law, such direct feedback between the two layers could increase
volatility and lower the system's robustness to uncertainty in demand and
generation. A new notion of generalized price-elasticity is introduced, and it
is shown that price volatility can be characterized in terms of the system's
maximal relative price elasticity, defined as the maximal ratio of the
generalized price-elasticity of consumers to that of the producers. As this
ratio increases, the system becomes more volatile, and eventually, unstable. As
new demand response technologies and distributed storage increase the
price-elasticity of demand, the architecture under examination is likely to
lead to increased volatility and possibly instability. This highlights the need
for assessing architecture systematically and in advance, in order to optimally
strike the trade-offs between volatility, economic efficiency, and system
reliability.
