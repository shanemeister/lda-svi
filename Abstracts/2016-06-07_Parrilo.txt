Title: How to flatten a soccer ball
Abstract: This is an experimental case study in real algebraic geometry, aimed at
computing the image of a semialgebraic subset of 3-space under a polynomial map
into the plane. For general instances, the boundary of the image is given by
two highly singular curves. We determine these curves and show how they
demarcate the "flattened soccer ball". We explore cylindrical algebraic
decompositions, by working through concrete examples. Maps onto convex polygons
and connections to convex optimization are also discussed.
