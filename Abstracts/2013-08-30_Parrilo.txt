Title: Stability of Polynomial Differential Equations: Complexity and Converse  Lyapunov Questions
Abstract: We consider polynomial differential equations and make a number of
contributions to the questions of (i) complexity of deciding stability, (ii)
existence of polynomial Lyapunov functions, and (iii) existence of sum of
squares (sos) Lyapunov functions.
(i) We show that deciding local or global asymptotic stability of cubic
vector fields is strongly NP-hard. Simple variations of our proof are shown to
imply strong NP-hardness of several other decision problems: testing local
attractivity of an equilibrium point, stability of an equilibrium point in the
sense of Lyapunov, invariance of the unit ball, boundedness of trajectories,
convergence of all trajectories in a ball to a given equilibrium point,
existence of a quadratic Lyapunov function, local collision avoidance, and
existence of a stabilizing control law.
(ii) We present a simple, explicit example of a globally asymptotically
stable quadratic vector field on the plane which does not admit a polynomial
Lyapunov function (joint work with M. Krstic). For the subclass of homogeneous
vector fields, we conjecture that asymptotic stability implies existence of a
polynomial Lyapunov function, but show that the minimum degree of such a
Lyapunov function can be arbitrarily large even for vector fields in fixed
dimension and degree. For the same class of vector fields, we further establish
that there is no monotonicity in the degree of polynomial Lyapunov functions.
(iii) We show via an explicit counterexample that if the degree of the
polynomial Lyapunov function is fixed, then sos programming may fail to find a
valid Lyapunov function even though one exists. On the other hand, if the
degree is allowed to increase, we prove that existence of a polynomial Lyapunov
function for a planar or a homogeneous vector field implies existence of a
polynomial Lyapunov function that is sos and that the negative of its
derivative is also sos.
