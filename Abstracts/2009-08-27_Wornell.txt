Title: Training-Based Schemes are Suboptimal for High Rate Asynchronous  Communication
Abstract: We consider asynchronous point-to-point communication. Building on a recently
developed model, we show that training based schemes, i.e., communication
strategies that separate synchronization from information transmission, perform
suboptimally at high rate.
