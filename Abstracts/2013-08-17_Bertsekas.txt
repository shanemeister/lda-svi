Title: A Mixed Value and Policy Iteration Method for Stochastic Control with  Universally Measurable Policies
Abstract: We consider stochastic control models with Borel spaces and universally
measurable policies. For such models the standard policy iteration is known to
have difficult measurability issues and cannot be carried out in general. We
present a mixed value and policy iteration method that circumvents this
difficulty. The method allows the use of stationary policies in computing the
optimal cost function, in a manner that resembles policy iteration. It can also
be used to address similar difficulties of policy iteration in the context of
upper and lower semicontinuous models. We analyze the convergence of the method
in infinite horizon total cost problems, for the discounted case where the
one-stage costs are bounded, and for the undiscounted case where the one-stage
costs are nonpositive or nonnegative.
For undiscounted total cost problems with nonnegative one-stage costs, we
also give a new convergence theorem for value iteration, which shows that value
iteration converges whenever it is initialized with a function that is above
the optimal cost function and yet bounded by a multiple of the optimal cost
function. This condition resembles Whittle's bridging condition and is partly
motivated by it. The theorem is also partly motivated by a result of Maitra and
Sudderth, which showed that value iteration, when initialized with the constant
function zero, could require a transfinite number of iterations to converge. We
use the new convergence theorem for value iteration to establish the
convergence of our mixed value and policy iteration method for the nonnegative
cost case.
