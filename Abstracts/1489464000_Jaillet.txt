Title: The Stochastic Container Relocation Problem
Abstract: The Container Relocation Problem (CRP) is concerned with finding a sequence
of moves of containers that minimizes the number of relocations needed to
retrieve all containers, while respecting a given order of retrieval. However,
the assumption of knowing the full retrieval order of containers is
particularly unrealistic in real operations. This paper studies the stochastic
CRP (SCRP), which relaxes this assumption. A new multi-stage stochastic model,
called the batch model, is introduced, motivated, and compared with an existing
model (the online model). The two main contributions are an optimal algorithm
called Pruning-Best-First-Search (PBFS) and a randomized approximate algorithm
called PBFS-Approximate with a bounded average error. Both algorithms,
applicable in the batch and online models, are based on a new family of lower
bounds for which we show some theoretical properties. Moreover, we introduce
two new heuristics outperforming the best existing heuristics. Algorithms,
bounds and heuristics are tested in an extensive computational section.
Finally, based on strong computational evidence, we conjecture the optimality
of the "Leveling" heuristic in a special "no information" case, where at any
retrieval stage, any of the remaining containers is equally likely to be
retrieved next.
