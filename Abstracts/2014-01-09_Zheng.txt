Title: Achievability of Nonlinear Degrees of Freedom in Correlatively Changing  Fading Channels
Abstract: A new approach toward the noncoherent communications over the time varying
fading channels is presented. In this approach, the relationship between the
input signal space and the output signal space of a correlatively changing
fading channel is shown to be a nonlinear mapping between manifolds of
different dimensions. Studying this mapping, it is shown that using nonlinear
decoding algorithms for single input-multiple output (SIMO) and multiple input
multiple output (MIMO) systems, extra numbers of degrees of freedom (DOF) are
available. We call them the nonlinear degrees of freedom.
