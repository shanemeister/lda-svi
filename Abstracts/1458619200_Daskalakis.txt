Title: Dynamical instability of a non-equilibrium exciton-polariton condensate
Abstract: By imaging single-shot realizations of an organic polariton quantum fluid, we
observe the long-sought dynamical instability of non-equilibrium condensates.
Without any free parameters, we find an excellent agreement between the
experimental data and a numerical simulation of the open-dissipative
Gross-Pitaevskii equation, which allows us to draw several important
conclusions about the physics of the system. We find that the reservoir
dynamics are in the strongly nonadiabatic regime, which renders the complex
Ginzburg-Landau description invalid. The observed transition from stable to
unstable fluid can only be explained by taking into account the specific form
of reservoir-mediated instability as well as particle currents induced by the
finite extent of the pump spot.
