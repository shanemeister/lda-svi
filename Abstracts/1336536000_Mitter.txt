Title: Optimal Control and Estimation for Partially Nested Interconnected  Systems
Abstract: In this paper, we study distributed estimation and control problems over
graphs under partially nested information patterns. We show a duality result
that is very similar to the classical duality result between state estimation
and state feedback control with a classical information pattern, under the
condition that the disturbances entering different systems on the graph are
uncorrelated. The distributed estimation problem decomposes into $N$ separate
estimation problems, where $N$ is the number of interconnected subsystems over
the graph, and the solution to each subproblem is simply the optimal Kalman
filter. This also gives the solution to the distributed control problem due to
the duality of distributed estimation and control under partially nested
information pattern. We then consider a weighted distributed estimation
problem, where we get coupling between the estimators, and separation between
the estimators is not possible. We propose a solution based on linear quadratic
team decision theory, which provides a generalized Riccati equation for teams.
We show that the weighted estimation problem is the dual to a distributed state
feedback problem, where the disturbances entering the interconnected systems
are correlated.
