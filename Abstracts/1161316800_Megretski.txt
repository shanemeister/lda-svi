Title: Input Classes for Identification of Bilinear Systems
Abstract: This paper asks what classes of input signals are sufficient in order to
completely identify the input/output behavior of generic bilinear systems. The
main results are that step inputs are not sufficient, nor are single pulses,
but the family of all pulses (of a fixed amplitude but varying widths) do
suffice for identification.
