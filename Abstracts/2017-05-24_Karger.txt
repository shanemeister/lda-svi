Title: Matroids Hitting Sets and Unsupervised Dependency Grammar Induction
Abstract: This paper formulates a novel problem on graphs: find the minimal subset of
edges in a fully connected graph, such that the resulting graph contains all
spanning trees for a set of specifed sub-graphs. This formulation is motivated
by an un-supervised grammar induction problem from computational linguistics.
We present a reduction to some known problems and algorithms from graph theory,
provide computational complexity results, and describe an approximation
algorithm.
