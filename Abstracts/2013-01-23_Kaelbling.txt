Title: Solving POMDPs by Searching the Space of Finite Policies
Abstract: Solving partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is highly
intractable in general, at least in part because the optimal policy may be
infinitely large. In this paper, we explore the problem of finding the optimal
policy from a restricted set of policies, represented as finite state automata
of a given size. This problem is also intractable, but we show that the
complexity can be greatly reduced when the POMDP and/or policy are further
constrained. We demonstrate good empirical results with a branch-and-bound
method for finding globally optimal deterministic policies, and a
gradient-ascent method for finding locally optimal stochastic policies.
