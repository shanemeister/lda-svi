Title: Optimal Sampling and Remote Estimation of the Wiener Process over a  Channel with Random Delay
Abstract: In this paper, we consider a sampling and remote estimation problem, where
samples of a Wiener process are forwarded to a remote estimator via a channel
with queueing and random delay. The estimator reconstructs an estimate of the
real-time signal value from causally received samples. We obtain the jointly
optimal sampling and estimation strategy that minimizes the mean-square
estimation error subject to a maximum sampling rate constraint. We prove that a
threshold-based sampler and a minimum mean-square error (MMSE) estimator are
jointly optimal, and the optimal threshold is found exactly. Our jointly
optimal solution exhibits an interesting coupling between the source and
channel, which is different from the source-channel separation in many previous
information theoretical studies. If the sampling times are independent of the
observed Wiener process, the joint sampling and estimation optimization problem
reduces to an age-of-information optimization problem that has been recently
solved. Our theoretical and numerical comparisons show that the estimation
error of the optimal sampling policy can be much smaller than those of
age-optimal sampling, zero-wait sampling, and classic periodic sampling.
