Title: Variational Bayes for Merging Noisy Databases
Abstract: Bayesian entity resolution merges together multiple, noisy databases and
returns the minimal collection of unique individuals represented, together with
their true, latent record values. Bayesian methods allow flexible generative
models that share power across databases as well as principled quantification
of uncertainty for queries of the final, resolved database. However, existing
Bayesian methods for entity resolution use Markov monte Carlo method (MCMC)
approximations and are too slow to run on modern databases containing millions
or billions of records. Instead, we propose applying variational approximations
to allow scalable Bayesian inference in these models. We derive a
coordinate-ascent approximation for mean-field variational Bayes, qualitatively
compare our algorithm to existing methods, note unique challenges for inference
that arise from the expected distribution of cluster sizes in entity
resolution, and discuss directions for future work in this domain.
