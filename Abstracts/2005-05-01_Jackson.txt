Title: Invariant curves for birational surface maps
Abstract: We classify invariant curves for birational surface maps that are expanding
on cohomology. When the expansion is exponential, the arithmetic genus of an
invariant curve is at most one. This implies severe constraints on both the
type and number of irreducible components of the curve. In the case of an
invariant curve with genus equal to one, we show that there is an associated
invariant meromorphic two form.
