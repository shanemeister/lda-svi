Title: Metric recovery from directed unweighted graphs
Abstract: We analyze directed, unweighted graphs obtained from $x_i\in \mathbb{R}^d$ by
connecting vertex $i$ to $j$ iff $|x_i - x_j| < \epsilon(x_i)$. Examples of
such graphs include $k$-nearest neighbor graphs, where $\epsilon(x_i)$ varies
from point to point, and, arguably, many real world graphs such as
co-purchasing graphs. We ask whether we can recover the underlying Euclidean
metric $\epsilon(x_i)$ and the associated density $p(x_i)$ given only the
directed graph and $d$.
We show that consistent recovery is possible up to isometric scaling when the
vertex degree is at least $\omega(n^{2/(2+d)}\log(n)^{d/(d+2)})$. Our estimator
is based on a careful characterization of a random walk over the directed graph
and the associated continuum limit. As an algorithm, it resembles the PageRank
centrality metric. We demonstrate empirically that the estimator performs well
on simulated examples as well as on real-world co-purchasing graphs even with a
small number of points and degree scaling as low as $\log(n)$.
