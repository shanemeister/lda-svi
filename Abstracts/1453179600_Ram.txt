Title: High-speed modulator with interleaved junctions in zero-change CMOS  photonics
Abstract: A microring depletion modulator is demonstrated with T-shaped lateral p-n
junctions used to realize efficient modulation while maximizing the RC limited
bandwidth. The device having a 3 dB bandwidth of 13 GHz has been fabricated in
a standard 45 nm microelectronics CMOS process. The cavity has a linewidth of
17 GHz and an average wavelength-shift of 9 pm/V in reverse-bias conditions.
