Title: Distributed Simultaneous Action and Target Assignment for Multi-Robot  Multi-Target Tracking
Abstract: We study a multi-robot assignment problem for multi-target tracking. The
proposed problem can be viewed as the mixed packing and covering problem. To
deal with a limitation on both sensing and communication ranges, a distributed
approach is taken into consideration. A local algorithm gives theoretical
bounds on both the running time and approximation ratio to an optimal solution.
We employ a local algorithm of max-min linear programs to solve the proposed
task. Simulation result shows that a local algorithm is an effective solution
to the multi-robot task allocation.
