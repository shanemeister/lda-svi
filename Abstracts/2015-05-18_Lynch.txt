Title: A Local Broadcast Layer for the SINR Network Model
Abstract: We present the first algorithm that implements an abstract MAC (absMAC) layer
in the Signal-to-Interference-plus-Noise-Ratio (SINR) wireless network model.
We first prove that efficient SINR implementations are not possible for the
standard absMAC specification. We modify that specification to an "approximate"
version that better suits the SINR model. We give an efficient algorithm to
implement the modified specification, and use it to derive efficient algorithms
for higher-level problems of global broadcast and consensus.
In particular, we show that the absMAC progress property has no efficient
implementation in terms of the SINR strong connectivity graph $G_{1-\epsilon}$,
which contains edges between nodes of distance at most $(1-\epsilon)$ times the
transmission range, where $\epsilon>0$ is a small constant that can be chosen
by the user. This progress property bounds the time until a node is guaranteed
to receive some message when at least one of its neighbors is transmitting.
To overcome this limitation, we introduce the slightly weaker notion of
approximate progress into the absMAC specification. We provide a fast
implementation of the modified specification, based on decomposing a known
algorithm into local and global parts. We analyze our algorithm in terms of
local parameters such as node degrees, rather than global parameters such as
the overall number of nodes. A key contribution is our demonstration that such
a local analysis is possible even in the presence of global interference.
Our absMAC algorithm leads to several new, efficient algorithms for solving
higher-level problems in the SINR model. Namely, by combining our algorithm
with known high-level algorithms, we obtain an improved algorithm for global
single-message broadcast in the SINR model, and the first efficient algorithm
for multi-message broadcast in that model.
