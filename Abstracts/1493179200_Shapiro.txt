Title: Noisy entanglement-assisted classical capacity as a security framework  for two-way quantum key distribution protocols
Abstract: We use the noisy entanglement-assisted classical capacity formula
[arXiv:1609.08592] to create a coherent-attack security framework for Gaussian
two-way quantum key distribution protocols in the asymptotic region.
