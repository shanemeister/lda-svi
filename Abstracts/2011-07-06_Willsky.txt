Title: High-Dimensional Gaussian Graphical Model Selection: Walk Summability  and Local Separation Criterion
Abstract: We consider the problem of high-dimensional Gaussian graphical model
selection. We identify a set of graphs for which an efficient estimation
algorithm exists, and this algorithm is based on thresholding of empirical
conditional covariances. Under a set of transparent conditions, we establish
structural consistency (or sparsistency) for the proposed algorithm, when the
number of samples n=omega(J_{min}^{-2} log p), where p is the number of
variables and J_{min} is the minimum (absolute) edge potential of the graphical
model. The sufficient conditions for sparsistency are based on the notion of
walk-summability of the model and the presence of sparse local vertex
separators in the underlying graph. We also derive novel non-asymptotic
necessary conditions on the number of samples required for sparsistency.
