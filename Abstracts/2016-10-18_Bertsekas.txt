Title: Proximal Algorithms and Temporal Differences for Large Linear Systems:  Extrapolation, Approximation, and Simulation
Abstract: In this paper we consider large linear fixed point problems and solution with
proximal algorithms. We show that, under certain assumptions, there is a close
connection between proximal iterations, which are prominent in numerical
analysis and optimization, and multistep methods of the temporal difference
type such as TD(lambda), LSTD(lambda), and LSPE(lambda), which are central in
simulation-based approximate dynamic programming. As an application of this
connection, we show that we may accelerate the standard proximal algorithm by
extrapolation towards the multistep iteration, which generically has a faster
convergence rate. We also use the connection with multistep methods to
integrate into the proximal algorithmic context several new ideas that have
emerged in the approximate dynamic programming context. In particular, we
consider algorithms that project each proximal iterate onto the subspace
spanned by a small number of basis functions, using low-dimensional
calculations and simulation, and we discuss various algorithmic options from
approximate dynamic programming.
