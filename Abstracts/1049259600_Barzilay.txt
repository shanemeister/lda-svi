Title: Learning to Paraphrase: An Unsupervised Approach Using Multiple-Sequence  Alignment
Abstract: We address the text-to-text generation problem of sentence-level paraphrasing
-- a phenomenon distinct from and more difficult than word- or phrase-level
paraphrasing. Our approach applies multiple-sequence alignment to sentences
gathered from unannotated comparable corpora: it learns a set of paraphrasing
patterns represented by word lattice pairs and automatically determines how to
apply these patterns to rewrite new sentences. The results of our evaluation
experiments show that the system derives accurate paraphrases, outperforming
baseline systems.
