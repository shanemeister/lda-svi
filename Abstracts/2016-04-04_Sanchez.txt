Title: Observation of Topological Nodal Fermion Semimetal Phase in ZrSiS
Abstract: Unveiling new topological phases of matter is one of the current objectives
in condensed matter physics. Recent experimental discoveries of Dirac and Weyl
semimetals prompt to search for other exotic phases of matter. Here we present
a systematic angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) study of ZrSiS,
a prime topological nodal semimetal candidate. Our wider Brillouin zone (BZ)
mapping shows multiple Fermi surface pockets such as the diamond-shaped Fermi
surface, ellipsoidal-shaped Fermi surface, and a small electron pocket
encircling at the zone center (G) point, the M point and the X point of the BZ,
respectively. We experimentally establish the spinless nodal fermion semimetal
phase in ZrSiS, which is supported by our first-principles calculations. Our
findings evidence that the ZrSiS-type of material family is a new platform to
explore exotic states of quantum matter, while these materials are expected to
provide an avenue for engineering two-dimensional topological insulator
systems.
