Title: Speedy Browsing and Sampling with NeedleTail
Abstract: Exploratory data analysis often involves repeatedly browsing small samples of
records that satisfy certain ad-hoc predicates, to form and test hypotheses,
identify correlations, or make inferences. Unfortunately, existing database
systems are not optimized for queries with a LIMIT clause---operating instead
in an all-or-nothing manner. While workload aware caching, indexing, or
precomputation schemes may appear promising remedies, they do not apply in an
exploratory setting where the queries are ad-hoc and unpredictable. In this
paper, we propose a fast sampling engine, called NeedleTail, aimed at letting
analysts browse a small sample of the query results on large datasets as
quickly as possible, independent of the overall size of the result set.
NeedleTail introduces density maps, a lightweight in-memory indexing structure,
and a set of efficient algorithms (with desirable theoretical guarantees) to
quickly locate promising blocks, trading off locality and density. In settings
where the samples are used to compute aggregates, we extend techniques from the
statistics literature---in particular, from survey sampling---to mitigate the
bias from using our sampling algorithms. Our experimental results demonstrate
that NeedleTail returns results an order of magnitude faster while occupying up
to 30x less memory than existing sampling techniques.
