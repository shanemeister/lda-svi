Title: Incorporating Type II Error Probabilities from Independence Tests into  Score-Based Learning of Bayesian Network Structure
Abstract: We give a new consistent scoring function for structure learning of Bayesian
networks. In contrast to traditional approaches to score-based structure
learning, such as BDeu or MDL, the complexity penalty that we propose is
data-dependent and is given by the probability that a conditional independence
test correctly shows that an edge cannot exist. What really distinguishes this
new scoring function from earlier work is that it has the property of becoming
computationally easier to maximize as the amount of data increases. We prove a
polynomial sample complexity result, showing that maximizing this score is
guaranteed to correctly learn a structure with no false edges and a
distribution close to the generating distribution, whenever there exists a
Bayesian network which is a perfect map for the data generating distribution.
Although the new score can be used with any search algorithm, in our related
UAI 2013 paper [BS13], we have given empirical results showing that it is
particularly effective when used together with a linear programming relaxation
approach to Bayesian network structure learning. The present paper contains all
details of the proofs of the finite-sample complexity results in [BS13] as well
as detailed explanation of the computation of the certain error probabilities
called beta-values, whose precomputation and tabulation is necessary for the
implementation of the algorithm in [BS13].
