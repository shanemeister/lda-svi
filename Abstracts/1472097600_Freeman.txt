Title: Ambient Sound Provides Supervision for Visual Learning
Abstract: The sound of crashing waves, the roar of fast-moving cars -- sound conveys
important information about the objects in our surroundings. In this work, we
show that ambient sounds can be used as a supervisory signal for learning
visual models. To demonstrate this, we train a convolutional neural network to
predict a statistical summary of the sound associated with a video frame. We
show that, through this process, the network learns a representation that
conveys information about objects and scenes. We evaluate this representation
on several recognition tasks, finding that its performance is comparable to
that of other state-of-the-art unsupervised learning methods. Finally, we show
through visualizations that the network learns units that are selective to
objects that are often associated with characteristic sounds.
