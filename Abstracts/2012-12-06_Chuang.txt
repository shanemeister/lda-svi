Title: Transparent ion trap with integrated photodetector
Abstract: Fluorescence collection sets the efficiency of state detection and the rate
of entanglement generation between remote trapped ion qubits. Despite efforts
to improve light collection using various optical elements, solid angle capture
is limited to ~10% for implementations that are scalable to many ions. We
present an approach based on fluorescence detection through a transparent trap
using an integrated photodetector, combining collection efficiency approaching
50% with scalability. We microfabricate transparent surface traps with indium
tin oxide and verify stable trapping of single ions. The fluorescence from a
cloud of ions is detected using a photodiode sandwiched with a transparent
trap.
