Title: On Sampling from the Gibbs Distribution with Random Maximum A-Posteriori  Perturbations
Abstract: In this paper we describe how MAP inference can be used to sample efficiently
from Gibbs distributions. Specifically, we provide means for drawing either
approximate or unbiased samples from Gibbs' distributions by introducing low
dimensional perturbations and solving the corresponding MAP assignments. Our
approach also leads to new ways to derive lower bounds on partition functions.
We demonstrate empirically that our method excels in the typical "high signal -
high coupling" regime. The setting results in ragged energy landscapes that are
challenging for alternative approaches to sampling and/or lower bounds.
