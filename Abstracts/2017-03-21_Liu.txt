Title: Room temperature spin-orbit torque switching induced by a topological  insulator
Abstract: Recent studies on the magneto-transport properties of topological insulators
(TI) have attracted great attention due to the rich spin-orbit physics and
promising applications in spintronic devices. Particularly the strongly
spin-moment coupled electronic states have been extensively pursued to realize
efficient spin-orbit torque (SOT) switching. However, so far current-induced
magnetic switching with TI has only been observed at cryogenic temperatures. It
remains a controversial issue whether the topologically protected electronic
states in TI could benefit spintronic applications at room temperature. In this
work, we report full SOT switching in a TI/ferromagnet bilayer heterostructure
with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at room temperature. The low switching
current density provides a definitive proof on the high SOT efficiency from TI.
The effective spin Hall angle of TI is determined to be several times larger
than commonly used heavy metals. Our results demonstrate the robustness of TI
as an SOT switching material and provide a direct avenue towards applicable
TI-based spintronic devices.
