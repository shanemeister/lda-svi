Title: Faster all-pairs shortest paths via circuit complexity
Abstract: We present a new randomized method for computing the min-plus product
(a.k.a., tropical product) of two $n \times n$ matrices, yielding a faster
algorithm for solving the all-pairs shortest path problem (APSP) in dense
$n$-node directed graphs with arbitrary edge weights. On the real RAM, where
additions and comparisons of reals are unit cost (but all other operations have
typical logarithmic cost), the algorithm runs in time
\[\frac{n^3}{2^{\Omega(\log n)^{1/2}}}\] and is correct with high probability.
On the word RAM, the algorithm runs in $n^3/2^{\Omega(\log n)^{1/2}} +
n^{2+o(1)}\log M$ time for edge weights in $([0,M] \cap {\mathbb
Z})\cup\{\infty\}$. Prior algorithms used either $n^3/(\log^c n)$ time for
various $c \leq 2$, or $O(M^{\alpha}n^{\beta})$ time for various $\alpha > 0$
and $\beta > 2$.
The new algorithm applies a tool from circuit complexity, namely the
Razborov-Smolensky polynomials for approximately representing ${\sf AC}^0[p]$
circuits, to efficiently reduce a matrix product over the $(\min,+)$ algebra to
a relatively small number of rectangular matrix products over ${\mathbb F}_2$,
each of which are computable using a particularly efficient method due to
Coppersmith. We also give a deterministic version of the algorithm running in
$n^3/2^{\log^{\delta} n}$ time for some $\delta > 0$, which utilizes the
Yao-Beigel-Tarui translation of ${\sf AC}^0[m]$ circuits into "nice" depth-two
circuits.
