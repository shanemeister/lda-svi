Title: Bounds between Contraction Coefficients
Abstract: In this paper, we delineate how the contraction coefficient of the strong
data processing inequality for KL divergence can be used to learn likelihood
models. We then present an alternative formulation to learn likelihood models
that forces the input KL divergence of the data processing inequality to
vanish, and achieves a contraction coefficient equivalent to the squared
maximal correlation. This formulation turns out to admit a linear algebraic
solution. To analyze the performance loss in using this simple but suboptimal
procedure, we bound these contraction coefficients in the discrete and finite
regime, and prove their equivalence in the Gaussian regime.
