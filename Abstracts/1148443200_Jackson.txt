Title: Knowledge Flow Analysis for Security Protocols
Abstract: Knowledge flow analysis offers a simple and flexible way to find flaws in
security protocols. A protocol is described by a collection of rules
constraining the propagation of knowledge amongst principals. Because this
characterization corresponds closely to informal descriptions of protocols, it
allows a succinct and natural formalization; because it abstracts away message
ordering, and handles communications between principals and applications of
cryptographic primitives uniformly, it is readily represented in a standard
logic. A generic framework in the Alloy modelling language is presented, and
instantiated for two standard protocols, and a new key management scheme.
