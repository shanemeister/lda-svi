Title: Scheduling Kalman Filters in Continuous Time
Abstract: A set of N independent Gaussian linear time invariant systems is observed by
M sensors whose task is to provide the best possible steady-state causal
minimum mean square estimate of the state of the systems, in addition to
minimizing a steady-state measurement cost. The sensors can switch between
systems instantaneously, and there are additional resource constraints, for
example on the number of sensors which can observe a given system
simultaneously. We first derive a tractable relaxation of the problem, which
provides a bound on the achievable performance. This bound can be computed by
solving a convex program involving linear matrix inequalities. Exploiting the
additional structure of the sites evolving independently, we can decompose this
program into coupled smaller dimensional problems. In the scalar case with
identical sensors, we give an analytical expression of an index policy proposed
in a more general context by Whittle. In the general case, we develop open-loop
periodic switching policies whose performance matches the bound arbitrarily
closely.
