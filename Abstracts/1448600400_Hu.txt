Title: Effect of interstitial-driven lattice expansion on the stacking fault  energy in austenitic steels
Abstract: Interstitials (carbon and nitrogen) are crucial alloying elements for
optimizing the mechanical performance of the twinning-induced plasticity (TWIP)
steels in terms of the stacking fault energy (SFE). First-principles
calculations have been performed to study the effect of interstitial-induced
lattice expansion on the SFE. Comparing the predictions with the SFEs measured
for alloys containing C and N, our results suggest that the dominant effect of
these interstitials on the SFE is due to the lattice expansion effect.
