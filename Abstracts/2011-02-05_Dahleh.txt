Title: Robust Distributed Routing in Dynamical Flow Networks - Part I: Locally  Responsive Policies and Weak Resilience
Abstract: Robustness of distributed routing policies is studied for dynamical flow
networks, with respect to adversarial disturbances that reduce the link flow
capacities. A dynamical flow network is modeled as a system of ordinary
differential equations derived from mass conservation laws on a directed
acyclic graph with a single origin-destination pair and a constant inflow at
the origin. Routing policies regulate the way the inflow at a non-destination
node gets split among its outgoing links as a function of the current particle
density, while the outflow of a link is modeled to depend on the current
particle density on that link through a flow function. The dynamical flow
network is called partially transferring if the total inflow at the destination
node is asymptotically bounded away from zero, and its weak resilience is
measured as the minimum sum of the link-wise magnitude of all disturbances that
make it not partially transferring. The weak resilience of a dynamical flow
network with arbitrary routing policy is shown to be upper-bounded by the
network's min-cut capacity, independently of the initial flow conditions.
Moreover, a class of distributed routing policies that rely exclusively on
local information on the particle densities, and are locally responsive to
that, is shown to yield such maximal weak resilience. These results imply that
locality constraints on the information available to the routing policies do
not cause loss of weak resilience. Some fundamental properties of dynamical
flow networks driven by locally responsive distributed policies are analyzed in
detail, including global convergence to a unique limit flow.
