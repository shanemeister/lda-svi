Title: Filling a Hole in a Crease Pattern: Isometric Mapping from Prescribed  Boundary Folding
Abstract: Given a sheet of paper and a prescribed folding of its boundary, is there a
way to fold the paper's interior without stretching so that the boundary lines
up with the prescribed boundary folding? For polygonal boundaries
nonexpansively folded at finitely many points, we prove that a consistent
isometric mapping of the polygon interior always exists and is computable in
polynomial time.
