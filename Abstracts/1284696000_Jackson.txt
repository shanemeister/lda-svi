Title: Computer Generated Images for Quadratic Rational Maps with a Periodic  Critical Point
Abstract: We describe an algorithm for distinguishing hyperbolic components in the
parameter space of quadratic rational maps with a periodic critical point. We
then illustrate computer images of the hyperbolic components of the parameter
spaces V1 - V4, which were produced using our algorithm. We also resolve the
singularities of the projective closure of V5 by blowups, giving an alternative
proof that as an algebraic curve, the geometric genus of V5 is 1. This explains
why we are unable to produce an image for V5.
