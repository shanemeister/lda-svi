Title: On the Importance of Registers for Computability
Abstract: All consensus hierarchies in the literature assume that we have, in addition
to copies of a given object, an unbounded number of registers. But why do we
really need these registers?
This paper considers what would happen if one attempts to solve consensus
using various objects but without any registers. We show that under a
reasonable assumption, objects like queues and stacks cannot emulate the
missing registers. We also show that, perhaps surprisingly, initialization,
shown to have no computational consequences when registers are readily
available, is crucial in determining the synchronization power of objects when
no registers are allowed. Finally, we show that without registers, the number
of available objects affects the level of consensus that can be solved.
Our work thus raises the question of whether consensus hierarchies which
assume an unbounded number of registers truly capture synchronization power,
and begins a line of research aimed at better understanding the interaction
between read-write memory and the powerful synchronization operations available
on modern architectures.
