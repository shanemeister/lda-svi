Title: Fundamental Limits of Communication with Low Probability of Detection
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of communication over a discrete memoryless
channel (DMC) or an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel subject to the
constraint that the probability that an adversary who observes the channel
outputs can detect the communication is low. Specifically, the relative entropy
between the output distributions when a codeword is transmitted and when no
input is provided to the channel must be sufficiently small. For a DMC whose
output distribution induced by the "off" input symbol is not a mixture of the
output distributions induced by other input symbols, it is shown that the
maximum amount of information that can be transmitted under this criterion
scales like the square root of the blocklength. The same is true for the AWGN
channel. Exact expressions for the scaling constant are also derived.
