Title: Linear-Time Poisson-Disk Patterns
Abstract: We present an algorithm for generating Poisson-disc patterns taking O(N) time
to generate $N$ points. The method is based on a grid of regions which can
contain no more than one point in the final pattern, and uses an explicit model
of point arrival times under a uniform Poisson process.
