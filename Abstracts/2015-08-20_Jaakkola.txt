Title: Steps Toward Deep Kernel Methods from Infinite Neural Networks
Abstract: Contemporary deep neural networks exhibit impressive results on practical
problems. These networks generalize well although their inherent capacity may
extend significantly beyond the number of training examples. We analyze this
behavior in the context of deep, infinite neural networks. We show that deep
infinite layers are naturally aligned with Gaussian processes and kernel
methods, and devise stochastic kernels that encode the information of these
networks. We show that stability results apply despite the size, offering an
explanation for their empirical success.
