Title: MovieQA: Understanding Stories in Movies through Question-Answering
Abstract: We introduce the MovieQA dataset which aims to evaluate automatic story
comprehension from both video and text. The dataset consists of 14,944
questions about 408 movies with high semantic diversity. The questions range
from simpler "Who" did "What" to "Whom", to "Why" and "How" certain events
occurred. Each question comes with a set of five possible answers; a correct
one and four deceiving answers provided by human annotators. Our dataset is
unique in that it contains multiple sources of information -- video clips,
plots, subtitles, scripts, and DVS. We analyze our data through various
statistics and methods. We further extend existing QA techniques to show that
question-answering with such open-ended semantics is hard. We make this data
set public along with an evaluation benchmark to encourage inspiring work in
this challenging domain.
