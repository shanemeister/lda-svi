Title: Large-scale 2D Electronics based on Single-layer MoS2 Grown by Chemical  Vapor Deposition
Abstract: 2D nanoelectronics based on single-layer MoS2 offers great advantages for
both conventional and ubiquitous applications. This paper discusses the
large-scale CVD growth of single-layer MoS2 and fabrication of devices and
circuits for the first time. Both digital and analog circuits are fabricated to
demonstrate its capability for mixed-signal applications.
