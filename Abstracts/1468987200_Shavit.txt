Title: A Complexity-Based Hierarchy for Multiprocessor Synchronization
Abstract: For many years, Herlihy's elegant computability based Consensus Hierarchy has
been our best explanation of the relative power of various types of
multiprocessor synchronization objects when used in deterministic algorithms.
However, key to this hierarchy is treating synchronization instructions as
distinct objects, an approach that is far from the real-world, where
multiprocessor programs apply synchronization instructions to collections of
arbitrary memory locations. We were surprised to realize that, when considering
instructions applied to memory locations, the computability based hierarchy
collapses. This leaves open the question of how to better capture the power of
various synchronization instructions.
In this paper, we provide an approach to answering this question. We present
a hierarchy of synchronization instructions, classified by their space
complexity in solving obstruction-free consensus. Our hierarchy provides a
classification of combinations of known instructions that seems to fit with our
intuition of how useful some are in practice, while questioning the
effectiveness of others. We prove an essentially tight characterization of the
power of buffered read and write instructions.Interestingly, we show a similar
result for multi-location atomic assignments.
