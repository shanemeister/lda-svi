Title: Hardware for Machine Learning: Challenges and Opportunities
Abstract: Machine learning plays a critical role in extracting meaningful information
out of the zetabytes of sensor data collected every day. For some applications,
the goal is to analyze and understand the data to identify trends (e.g.,
surveillance, portable/wearable electronics); in other applications, the goal
is to take immediate action based the data (e.g., robotics/drones, self-driving
cars, smart Internet of Things). For many of these applications, local embedded
processing near the sensor is preferred over the cloud due to privacy or
latency concerns, or limitations in the communication bandwidth. However, at
the sensor there are often stringent constraints on energy consumption and cost
in addition to throughput and accuracy requirements. Furthermore, flexibility
is often required such that the processing can be adapted for different
applications or environments (e.g., update the weights and model in the
classifier). In many applications, machine learning often involves transforming
the input data into a higher dimensional space, which, along with programmable
weights, increases data movement and consequently energy consumption. In this
paper, we will discuss how these challenges can be addressed at various levels
of hardware design ranging from architecture, hardware-friendly algorithms,
mixed-signal circuits, and advanced technologies (including memories and
sensors).
