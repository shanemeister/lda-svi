Title: FAST: Free Adaptive Super-Resolution via Transfer for Compressed Videos
Abstract: High resolution displays are increasingly popular, requiring most of the
existing video content to be adapted to higher resolution. State-of-the-art
super-resolution algorithms mainly address the visual quality of the output
instead of real-time throughput. This paper introduces FAST, a framework to
accelerate any image based super-resolution algorithm running on compressed
videos. FAST leverages the similarity between adjacent frames in a video. Given
the output of a super-resolution algorithm on one frame, the technique
adaptively transfers it to the adjacent frames and skips running the
super-resolution algorithm. The transferring process has negligible computation
cost because the required information, including motion vectors, block size,
and prediction residual, are embedded in the compressed video for free. In this
work, we show that FAST accelerates state-of-the-art super-resolution
algorithms by up to an order of magnitude with acceptable quality loss of up to
0.2 dB. Thus, we believe that the FAST framework is an important step towards
enabling real-time super-resolution algorithms that upsample streamed videos
for large displays.
