Title: Equivalence perspectives in communication, source-channel connections  and universal source-channel separation
Abstract: An operational perspective is used to understand the relationship between
source and channel coding. This is based on a direct reduction of one problem
to another that uses random coding (and hence common randomness) but unlike all
prior work, does not involve any functional computations, in particular, no
mutual-information computations. This result is then used to prove a universal
source-channel separation theorem in the rate-distortion context where
universality is in the sense of a compound ``general channel.''
