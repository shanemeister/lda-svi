Title: New fermions on the line in topological symmorphic metals
Abstract: Topological metals and semimetals (TMs) have recently drawn significant
interest. These materials give rise to condensed matter realizations of many
important concepts in high-energy physics, leading to wide-ranging protected
properties in transport and spectroscopic experiments. The most studied TMs,
i.e., Weyl and Dirac semimetals, feature quasiparticles that are direct
analogues of the textbook elementary particles. Moreover, the TMs known so far
can be characterized based on the dimensionality of the band crossing. While
Weyl and Dirac semimetals feature zero-dimensional points, the band crossing of
nodal-line semimetals forms a one-dimensional closed loop. In this paper, we
identify a TM which breaks the above paradigms. Firstly, the TM features
triply-degenerate band crossing in a symmorphic lattice, hence realizing
emergent fermionic quasiparticles not present in quantum field theory.
Secondly, the band crossing is neither 0D nor 1D. Instead, it consists of two
isolated triply-degenerate nodes interconnected by multi-segments of lines with
two-fold degeneracy. We present materials candidates. We further show that
triplydegenerate band crossings in symmorphic crystals give rise to a Landau
level spectrum distinct from the known TMs, suggesting novel magneto-transport
responses. Our results open the door for realizing new topological phenomena
and fermions including transport anomalies and spectroscopic responses in
metallic crystals with nontrivial topology beyond the Weyl/Dirac paradigm.
