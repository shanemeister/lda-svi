Title: Including nuclear degrees of freedom in a lattice Hamiltonian
Abstract: Motivated by many observations of anomalies in condensed matter systems, we
consider a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which condensed matter and nuclear
systems are described initially on the same footing. Since it may be possible
that the lattice will respond to the mass change associated with a excited
nuclear state, we adopt a relativistic description throughout based on a
many-particle Dirac formalism. This approach has not been used in the past,
perhaps due to the difficulty in separating the center of mass and relative
degrees of freedom of the nuclear system, or perhaps due to an absence of
applications for such a model. In response to some recent ideas about how to
think about the center of mass and relative separation, we obtained from the
Dirac model a new fundamental Hamiltonian in which the lattice couples to
different states within the composite nuclei within the lattice. In this
description the different nuclear states have different mass energies and
kinetic energies, as we had expected. In addition there appear new terms which
provide for nuclear excitation as a result of coupling to the composite
momentum. This new effect comes about because of changes in the composite
nuclear state as a result of the dynamical Lorentz boost in the lattice.
