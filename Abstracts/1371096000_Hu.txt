Title: A convenient implementation of the overlap between arbitrary  Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov vacua for projection
Abstract: Overlap between Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov(HFB) vacua is very important in the
beyond mean-field calculations. However, in the HFB transformation, the $U,V$
matrices are sometimes singular due to the exact emptiness ($v_i=0$) or full
occupation ($u_i=0$) of some single-particle orbits. This singularity may cause
some problem in evaluating the overlap between HFB vacua through Pfaffian. We
found that this problem can be well avoided by setting those zero occupation
numbers to some tiny values (e.g., $u_i,v_i=10^{-8}$). This treatment does not
change the HFB vacuum state because $u_i^2,v_i^2=10^{-16}$ are numerically zero
relative to 1. Therefore, for arbitrary HFB transformation, we say that the
$U,V$ matrices can always be nonsingular. From this standpoint, we present a
new convenient Pfaffian formula for the overlap between arbitrary HFB vacua,
which is especially suitable for symmetry restoration. Testing calculations
have been performed for this new formula. It turns out that our method is
reliable and accurate in evaluating the overlap between arbitrary HFB vacua.
