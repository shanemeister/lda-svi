Title: Submodular meets Structured: Finding Diverse Subsets in  Exponentially-Large Structured Item Sets
Abstract: To cope with the high level of ambiguity faced in domains such as Computer
Vision or Natural Language processing, robust prediction methods often search
for a diverse set of high-quality candidate solutions or proposals. In
structured prediction problems, this becomes a daunting task, as the solution
space (image labelings, sentence parses, etc.) is exponentially large. We study
greedy algorithms for finding a diverse subset of solutions in
structured-output spaces by drawing new connections between submodular
functions over combinatorial item sets and High-Order Potentials (HOPs) studied
for graphical models. Specifically, we show via examples that when marginal
gains of submodular diversity functions allow structured representations, this
enables efficient (sub-linear time) approximate maximization by reducing the
greedy augmentation step to inference in a factor graph with appropriately
constructed HOPs. We discuss benefits, tradeoffs, and show that our
constructions lead to significantly better proposals.
