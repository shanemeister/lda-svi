Title: Deep Metric Learning via Facility Location
Abstract: Learning the representation and the similarity metric in an end-to-end
fashion with deep networks have demonstrated outstanding results for clustering
and retrieval. However, these recent approaches still suffer from the
performance degradation stemming from the local metric training procedure which
is unaware of the global structure of the embedding space.
We propose a global metric learning scheme for optimizing the deep metric
embedding with the learnable clustering function and the clustering metric
(NMI) in a novel structured prediction framework.
Our experiments on CUB200-2011, Cars196, and Stanford online products
datasets show state of the art performance both on the clustering and retrieval
tasks measured in the NMI and Recall@K evaluation metrics.
