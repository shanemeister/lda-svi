Title: Version 0.1 of the BigDAWG Polystore System
Abstract: A polystore system is a database management system (DBMS) composed of
integrated heterogeneous database engines and multiple programming languages.
By matching data to the storage engine best suited to its needs, complex
analytics run faster and flexible storage choices helps improve data
organization. BigDAWG (Big Data Working Group) is our reference implementation
of a polystore system. In this paper, we describe the current BigDAWG software
release which supports PostgreSQL, Accumulo and SciDB. We describe the overall
architecture, API and initial results of applying BigDAWG to the MIMIC II
medical dataset.
