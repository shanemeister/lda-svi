Title: Sphere Packing with Limited Overlap
Abstract: The classical sphere packing problem asks for the best (infinite) arrangement
of non-overlapping unit balls which cover as much space as possible. We define
a generalized version of the problem, where we allow each ball a limited amount
of overlap with other balls. We study two natural choices of overlap measures
and obtain the optimal lattice packings in a parameterized family of lattices
which contains the FCC, BCC, and integer lattice.
