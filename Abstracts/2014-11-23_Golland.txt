Title: Diversifying Sparsity Using Variational Determinantal Point Processes
Abstract: We propose a novel diverse feature selection method based on determinantal
point processes (DPPs). Our model enables one to flexibly define diversity
based on the covariance of features (similar to orthogonal matching pursuit) or
alternatively based on side information. We introduce our approach in the
context of Bayesian sparse regression, employing a DPP as a variational
approximation to the true spike and slab posterior distribution. We
subsequently show how this variational DPP approximation generalizes and
extends mean-field approximation, and can be learned efficiently by exploiting
the fast sampling properties of DPPs. Our motivating application comes from
bioinformatics, where we aim to identify a diverse set of genes whose
expression profiles predict a tumor type where the diversity is defined with
respect to a gene-gene interaction network. We also explore an application in
spatial statistics. In both cases, we demonstrate that the proposed method
yields significantly more diverse feature sets than classic sparse methods,
without compromising accuracy.
