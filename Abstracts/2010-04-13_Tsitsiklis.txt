Title: Distributed anonymous discrete function computation
Abstract: We propose a model for deterministic distributed function computation by a
network of identical and anonymous nodes. In this model, each node has bounded
computation and storage capabilities that do not grow with the network size.
Furthermore, each node only knows its neighbors, not the entire graph. Our goal
is to characterize the class of functions that can be computed within this
model. In our main result, we provide a necessary condition for computability
which we show to be nearly sufficient, in the sense that every function that
satisfies this condition can at least be approximated. The problem of computing
suitably rounded averages in a distributed manner plays a central role in our
development; we provide an algorithm that solves it in time that grows
quadratically with the size of the network.
