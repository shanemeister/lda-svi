Title: A 7/3-Approximation for Feedback Vertex Sets in Tournaments
Abstract: We consider the minimum-weight feedback vertex set problem in tournaments:
given a tournament with non-negative vertex weights, remove a minimum-weight
set of vertices that intersects all cycles. This problem is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard
to solve exactly, and Unique Games-hard to approximate by a factor better than
2. We present the first $7/3$ approximation algorithm for this problem,
improving on the previously best known ratio $5/2$ given by Cai et al. [FOCS
1998, SICOMP 2001].
