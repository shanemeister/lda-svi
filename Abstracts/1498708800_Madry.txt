Title: Towards Understanding the Dynamics of Generative Adversarial Networks
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have recently been proposed as a
promising avenue towards learning generative models with deep neural networks.
While GANs have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on multiple vision
tasks, their learning dynamics are not yet well understood, both in theory and
in practice. To address this issue, we take a first step towards a rigorous
study of GAN dynamics. We propose a simple model that exhibits several of the
common problematic convergence behaviors (e.g., vanishing gradient, mode
collapse, diverging or oscillatory behavior) and still allows us to establish
the first convergence bounds for parametric GAN dynamics. We find an
interesting dichotomy: a GAN with an optimal discriminator provably converges,
while a first order approximation of the discriminator leads to unstable GAN
dynamics and mode collapse. Our model and analysis point to a specific
challenge in practical GAN training that we call discriminator collapse.
