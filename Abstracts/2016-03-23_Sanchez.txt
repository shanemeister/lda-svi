Title: Discovery of Lorentz-violating Weyl fermion semimetal state in LaAlGe  materials
Abstract: We report theoretical and experimental discovery of Lorentz-violating Weyl
fermion semimetal type-II state in the LaAlGe class of materials. Previously
type-II Weyl state was predicted in WTe2 materials which remains unrealized in
surface experiments. We show theoretically and experimentally that LaAlGe class
of materials are the robust platforms for the study of type-II Weyl physics.
