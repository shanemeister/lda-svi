Title: Covariance Matrices and Influence Scores for Mean Field Variational  Bayes
Abstract: Mean field variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation
method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, it is well
known that a major failing of MFVB is that it underestimates the uncertainty of
model variables (sometimes severely) and provides no information about model
variable covariance. We develop a fast, general methodology for exponential
families that augments MFVB to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model
variables -- both for individual variables and coherently across variables.
MFVB for exponential families defines a fixed-point equation in the means of
the approximating posterior, and our approach yields a covariance estimate by
perturbing this fixed point. Inspired by linear response theory, we call our
method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). We also show how LRVB can be
used to quickly calculate a measure of the influence of individual data points
on parameter point estimates. We demonstrate the accuracy and scalability of
our method by learning Gaussian mixture models for both simulated and real
data.
