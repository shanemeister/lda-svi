Title: Streaming Non-monotone Submodular Maximization: Personalized Video  Summarization on the Fly
Abstract: The need for real time analysis of rapidly producing data streams (e.g.,
video and image streams) motivated the design of streaming algorithms that can
efficiently extract and summarize useful information from massive data "on the
fly". Such problems can often be reduced to maximizing a submodular set
function subject to various constraints. While efficient streaming methods have
been recently developed for monotone submodular maximization, in a wide range
of applications, such as video summarization, the underlying utility function
is non-monotone, and there are often various constraints imposed on the
optimization problem to consider privacy or personalization. We develop the
first efficient single pass streaming algorithm, Streaming Local Search, with
constant factor (4p-1)/4p(8p+2d-1) approximation guarantee for maximizing a
non-monotone submodular function under a p-system and d knapsack constraints,
with a memory independent of data size. In our experiments, we show that for
the video summarization problem, our streaming method, while achieving
practically the same performance, runs more than 1700 times faster than
previous work.
