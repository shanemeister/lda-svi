Title: A Big-Data Approach to Handle Process Variations: Uncertainty  Quantification by Tensor Recovery
Abstract: Stochastic spectral methods have become a popular technique to quantify the
uncertainties of nano-scale devices and circuits. They are much more efficient
than Monte Carlo for certain design cases with a small number of random
parameters. However, their computational cost significantly increases as the
number of random parameters increases. This paper presents a big-data approach
to solve high-dimensional uncertainty quantification problems. Specifically, we
simulate integrated circuits and MEMS at only a small number of quadrature
samples, then, a huge number of (e.g., $1.5 \times 10^{27}$) solution samples
are estimated from the available small-size (e.g., $500$) solution samples via
a low-rank and tensor-recovery method. Numerical results show that our
algorithm can easily extend the applicability of tensor-product stochastic
collocation to IC and MEMS problems with over 50 random parameters, whereas the
traditional algorithm can only handle several random parameters.
