Title: Time-Space Trade-offs in Population Protocols
Abstract: Population protocols are a popular model of distributed computing, in which
randomly-interacting agents with little computational power cooperate to
jointly perform computational tasks. Inspired by developments in molecular
computation, and in particular DNA computing, recent algorithmic work has
focused on the complexity of solving simple yet fundamental tasks in the
population model, such as leader election (which requires stabilization to a
single agent in a special "leader" state), and majority (in which agents must
stabilize to a decision as to which of two possible initial states had higher
initial count). Known results point towards an inherent trade-off between the
time complexity of such algorithms, and the space complexity, i.e. size of the
memory available to each agent.
In this paper, we explore this trade-off and provide new upper and lower
bounds for majority and leader election. First, we prove a unified lower bound,
which relates the space available per node with the time complexity achievable
by a protocol: for instance, our result implies that any protocol solving
either of these tasks for $n$ agents using $O( \log \log n )$ states must take
$\Omega( n / \rm{polylog} n )$ expected time. This is the first result to
characterize time complexity for protocols which employ super-constant number
of states per node, and proves that fast, poly-logarithmic running times
require protocols to have relatively large space costs.
On the positive side, we give algorithms showing that fast, poly-logarithmic
stabilization time can be achieved using $O( \log^2 n )$ space per node, in the
case of both tasks. Overall, our results highlight a time complexity separation
between $O(\log \log n)$ and $\Theta( \log^2 n )$ state space size for both
majority and leader election in population protocols, and introduce new
techniques, which should be applicable more broadly.
