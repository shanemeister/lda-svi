Title: Towards Closing the Energy Gap Between HOG and CNN Features for Embedded  Vision
Abstract: Computer vision enables a wide range of applications in robotics/drones,
self-driving cars, smart Internet of Things, and portable/wearable electronics.
For many of these applications, local embedded processing is preferred due to
privacy and/or latency concerns. Accordingly, energy-efficient embedded vision
hardware delivering real-time and robust performance is crucial. While deep
learning is gaining popularity in several computer vision algorithms, a
significant energy consumption difference exists compared to traditional
hand-crafted approaches. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the
computation, energy and accuracy trade-offs between learned features such as
deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and hand-crafted features such as
Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG). This analysis is supported by
measurements from two chips that implement these algorithms. Our goal is to
understand the source of the energy discrepancy between the two approaches and
to provide insight about the potential areas where CNNs can be improved and
eventually approach the energy-efficiency of HOG while maintaining its
outstanding performance accuracy.
