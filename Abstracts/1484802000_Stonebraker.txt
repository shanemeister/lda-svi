Title: BigDAWG Polystore Release and Demonstration
Abstract: The Intel Science and Technology Center for Big Data is developing a
reference implementation of a Polystore database. The BigDAWG (Big Data Working
Group) system supports "many sizes" of database engines, multiple programming
languages and complex analytics for a variety of workloads. Our recent efforts
include application of BigDAWG to an ocean metagenomics problem and
containerization of BigDAWG. We intend to release an open source BigDAWG v1.0
in the Spring of 2017. In this article, we will demonstrate a number of
polystore applications developed with oceanographic researchers at MIT and
describe our forthcoming open source release of the BigDAWG system.
