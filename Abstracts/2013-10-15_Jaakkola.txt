Title: On Measure Concentration of Random Maximum A-Posteriori Perturbations
Abstract: The maximum a-posteriori (MAP) perturbation framework has emerged as a useful
approach for inference and learning in high dimensional complex models. By
maximizing a randomly perturbed potential function, MAP perturbations generate
unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution. Unfortunately, the computational
cost of generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be
prohibitive. More efficient algorithms use sequential sampling strategies based
on the expected value of low dimensional MAP perturbations. This paper develops
new measure concentration inequalities that bound the number of samples needed
to estimate such expected values. Applying the general result to MAP
perturbations can yield a more efficient algorithm to approximate sampling from
the Gibbs distribution. The measure concentration result is of general interest
and may be applicable to other areas involving expected estimations.
