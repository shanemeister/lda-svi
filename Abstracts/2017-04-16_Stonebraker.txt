Title: SilkMoth: An Efficient Method for Finding Related Sets with Maximum  Matching Constraints
Abstract: Determining if two sets are related - that is, if they have similar values or
if one set contains the other - is an important problem with many applications
in data cleaning, data integration, and information retrieval. A particularly
popular metric that has been proposed is to measure the relatedness of two sets
by treating the elements as vertices of a bipartite graph and calculating the
score of the maximum matching pairing between elements. Compared to other
metrics which require exact matchings between elements, this metric uses a
similarity function to compare elements between the two sets, making it robust
to small dissimilarities in elements and more useful for real-world, dirty
data. Unfortunately, the metric suffers from expensive computational cost,
taking O(n^3) time, where n is the number of elements in sets, for each
set-to-set comparison. Thus for applications which try to search for all
pairings of related sets in a brute-force manner, the runtime becomes
unacceptably large.
To address this challenge, we developed SilkMoth, a system capable of rapidly
discovering related set pairs in collections of sets. Internally, SilkMoth
creates a signature for each set, with the property that any other set which is
related must match the signature. SilkMoth then uses these signatures to prune
the search space, so only sets which match the signatures are left as
candidates. Finally, SilkMoth applies the maximum matching metric on remaining
candidates to verify which of these candidates are truly related sets. Thus, a
contribution of this paper is the characterization of the space of signatures
which enable this property. We show that selecting the optimal signature in
this space is NP-complete, and based on insights from the characterization of
the space, we propose two novel filters which help to prune the candidates
further before verification.
