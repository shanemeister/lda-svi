Title: Rigid Origami Vertices: Conditions and Forcing Sets
Abstract: We develop an intrinsic necessary and sufficient condition for single-vertex
origami crease patterns to be able to fold rigidly. We classify such patterns
in the case where the creases are pre-assigned to be mountains and valleys as
well as in the unassigned case. We also illustrate the utility of this result
by applying it to the new concept of minimal forcing sets for rigid origami
models, which are the smallest collection of creases that, when folded, will
force all the other creases to fold in a prescribed way.
