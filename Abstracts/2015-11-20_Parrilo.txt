Title: Sampling algebraic varieties for sum of squares programs
Abstract: We study sum of squares (SOS) relaxations to decide the nonnegativity of a
polynomial $p$ on the set $V\cap R^n$, where $V$ is a complex algebraic
variety. We propose a new methodology that, rather than relying on some
algebraic description, represents $V$ with a generic set of complex samples.
This approach depends only on the geometry of $V$, avoiding representation
issues such as multiplicity and choice of generators. It also takes advantage
of the dependencies in the coordinate ring of $V$ to reduce the size of the
corresponding semidefinite program (SDP). In addition, the input can be given
as a straight-line program. Our methods are particularly appealing for
varieties which are easy to sample from but for which the defining equations
are complicated, such as $SO(n)$, Grassmannians or rank $k$ tensors.
Nonetheless, for arbitrary varieties we can obtain the samples by using the
tools of numerical algebraic geometry. In this way we connect the areas of SOS
optimization and numerical algebraic geometry.
