Title: Grounded Recurrent Neural Networks
Abstract: In this work, we present the Grounded Recurrent Neural Network (GRNN), a
recurrent neural network architecture for multi-label prediction which
explicitly ties labels to specific dimensions of the recurrent hidden state (we
call this process "grounding"). The approach is particularly well-suited for
extracting large numbers of concepts from text. We apply the new model to
address an important problem in healthcare of understanding what medical
concepts are discussed in clinical text. Using a publicly available dataset
derived from Intensive Care Units, we learn to label a patient's diagnoses and
procedures from their discharge summary. Our evaluation shows a clear advantage
to using our proposed architecture over a variety of strong baselines.
