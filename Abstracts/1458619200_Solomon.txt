Title: Continuous-Flow Graph Transportation Distances
Abstract: Optimal transportation distances are valuable for comparing and analyzing
probability distributions, but larger-scale computational techniques for the
theoretically favorable quadratic case are limited to smooth domains or
regularized approximations. Motivated by fluid flow-based transportation on
$\mathbb{R}^n$, however, this paper introduces an alternative definition of
optimal transportation between distributions over graph vertices. This new
distance still satisfies the triangle inequality but has better scaling and a
connection to continuous theories of transportation. It is constructed by
adapting a Riemannian structure over probability distributions to the graph
case, providing transportation distances as shortest-paths in probability
space. After defining and analyzing theoretical properties of our new distance,
we provide a time discretization as well as experiments verifying its
effectiveness.
