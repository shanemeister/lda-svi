Title: The Ramsey number of the clique and the hypercube
Abstract: The Ramsey number r(K_s,Q_n) is the smallest positive integer N such that
every red-blue colouring of the edges of the complete graph K_N on N vertices
contains either a red n-dimensional hypercube, or a blue clique on s vertices.
Answering a question of Burr and Erd\H{o}s from 1983, and improving on recent
results of Conlon, Fox, Lee and Sudakov, and of the current authors, we show
that r(K_s,Q_n) = (s-1) (2^n - 1) + 1 for every s \in \N and every sufficiently
large n \in \N.
