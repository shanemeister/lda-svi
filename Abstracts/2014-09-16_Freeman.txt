Title: Imaging an Event Horizon: Mitigation of Scattering Toward Sagittarius A*
Abstract: The image of the emission surrounding the black hole in the center of the
Milky Way is predicted to exhibit the imprint of general relativistic (GR)
effects, including the existence of a shadow feature and a photon ring of
diameter ~50 microarcseconds. Structure on these scales can be resolved by
millimeter-wavelength very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). However,
strong-field GR features of interest will be blurred at lambda >= 1.3 mm due to
scattering by interstellar electrons. The scattering properties are well
understood over most of the relevant range of baseline lengths, suggesting that
the scattering may be (mostly) invertible. We simulate observations of a model
image of Sgr A* and demonstrate that the effects of scattering can indeed be
mitigated by correcting the visibilities before reconstructing the image. This
technique is also applicable to Sgr A* at longer wavelengths.
