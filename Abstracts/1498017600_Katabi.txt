Title: Agile Millimeter Wave Networks with Provable Guarantees
Abstract: There is much interest in integrating millimeter wave radios (mmWave) into
wireless LANs and 5G cellular networks to benefit from their multiple GHz of
available spectrum. Yet unlike existing technologies, e.g., WiFi, mmWave radios
require highly directional antennas. Since the antennas have pencil-beams, the
transmitter and receiver need to align their antenna beams before they can
communicate. Existing solutions scan the entire space to find the best
alignment. Such a process has been shown to introduce up to seconds of delay,
and is unsuitable for wireless networks where an access point has to quickly
switch between users and accommodate mobile clients.
This paper presents Rapid-Link, a new protocol that can find the best mmWave
beam alignment without scanning the space. Given all possible directions for
setting the antenna beam, Rapid-Link provably finds the optimal direction in
logarithmic number of measurements. Further, Rapid-Link works within the
existing 802.11ad standard for mmWave LAN, and can support both clients and
access points. We have implemented Rapid-Link in a mmWave radio and evaluated
it empirically. Our results show that it reduces beam alignment delay by orders
of magnitude. In particular, for highly directional mmWave devices operating
under 802.11ad, the delay drops from over a second to 2.5 ms.
