Title: Magnetic oscillations driven by the spin Hall effect in 3-terminal  magnetic tunnel junction devices
Abstract: We show that direct current in a tantalum microstrip can induce steady-state
magnetic oscillations in an adjacent nanomagnet through spin torque from the
spin Hall effect (SHE). The oscillations are detected electrically via a
magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) contacting the nanomagnet. The oscillation
frequency can be controlled using the MTJ bias to tune the magnetic anisotropy.
In this 3-terminal device the SHE torque and the MTJ bias therefore provide
independent controls of the oscillation amplitude and frequency, enabling new
approaches for developing tunable spin torque nano-oscillators.
