Title: A modern solution to the Gion shrine problem
Abstract: We give a new solution to the famous Gion shrine geometry problem from
eighteenth-century Japan. Like the classical Japanese solution, ours is given
in the form of a degree ten equation. However, our polynomial has the advantage
of being much easier to write down. We also provide some additional analysis,
including a discussion of existence and uniqueness.
