Title: Partition-Merge: Distributed Inference and Modularity Optimization
Abstract: This paper presents a novel meta algorithm, Partition-Merge (PM), which takes
existing centralized algorithms for graph computation and makes them
distributed and faster. In a nutshell, PM divides the graph into small
subgraphs using our novel randomized partitioning scheme, runs the centralized
algorithm on each partition separately, and then stitches the resulting
solutions to produce a global solution. We demonstrate the efficiency of the PM
algorithm on two popular problems: computation of Maximum A Posteriori (MAP)
assignment in an arbitrary pairwise Markov Random Field (MRF), and modularity
optimization for community detection. We show that the resulting distributed
algorithms for these problems essentially run in time linear in the number of
nodes in the graph, and perform as well -- or even better -- than the original
centralized algorithm as long as the graph has geometric structures. Here we
say a graph has geometric structures, or polynomial growth property, when the
number of nodes within distance r of any given node grows no faster than a
polynomial function of r. More precisely, if the centralized algorithm is a
C-factor approximation with constant C \ge 1, the resulting distributed
algorithm is a (C+\delta)-factor approximation for any small \delta>0; but if
the centralized algorithm is a non-constant (e.g. logarithmic) factor
approximation, then the resulting distributed algorithm becomes a constant
factor approximation. For general graphs, we compute explicit bounds on the
loss of performance of the resulting distributed algorithm with respect to the
centralized algorithm.
