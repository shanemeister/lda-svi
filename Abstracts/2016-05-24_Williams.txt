Title: Deterministic Time-Space Tradeoffs for k-SUM
Abstract: Given a set of numbers, the $k$-SUM problem asks for a subset of $k$ numbers
that sums to zero. When the numbers are integers, the time and space complexity
of $k$-SUM is generally studied in the word-RAM model; when the numbers are
reals, the complexity is studied in the real-RAM model, and space is measured
by the number of reals held in memory at any point.
We present a time and space efficient deterministic self-reduction for the
$k$-SUM problem which holds for both models, and has many interesting
consequences. To illustrate:
* $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2 \lg\lg(n)/\lg(n))$ and space
$O\left(\sqrt{\frac{n \lg(n)}{\lg\lg(n)}}\right)$. In general, any
polylogarithmic-time improvement over quadratic time for $3$-SUM can be
converted into an algorithm with an identical time improvement but low space
complexity as well. * $3$-SUM is in deterministic time $O(n^2)$ and space
$O(\sqrt n)$, derandomizing an algorithm of Wang.
* A popular conjecture states that 3-SUM requires $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the
word-RAM. We show that the 3-SUM Conjecture is in fact equivalent to the
(seemingly weaker) conjecture that every $O(n^{.51})$-space algorithm for
$3$-SUM requires at least $n^{2-o(1)}$ time on the word-RAM.
* For $k \ge 4$, $k$-SUM is in deterministic $O(n^{k - 2 + 2/k})$ time and
$O(\sqrt{n})$ space.
