Title: A Practical Algorithm for Topic Modeling with Provable Guarantees
Abstract: Topic models provide a useful method for dimensionality reduction and
exploratory data analysis in large text corpora. Most approaches to topic model
inference have been based on a maximum likelihood objective. Efficient
algorithms exist that approximate this objective, but they have no provable
guarantees. Recently, algorithms have been introduced that provide provable
bounds, but these algorithms are not practical because they are inefficient and
not robust to violations of model assumptions. In this paper we present an
algorithm for topic model inference that is both provable and practical. The
algorithm produces results comparable to the best MCMC implementations while
running orders of magnitude faster.
