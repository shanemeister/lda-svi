Title: Separable Convex Optimization with Nested Lower and Upper Constraints
Abstract: We study a convex resource allocation problem in which lower and upper bounds
are imposed on partial sums of allocations. This model is linked to a large
range of applications, including production planning, speed optimization,
stratified sampling, support vector machines, portfolio management, and
telecommunications. We propose an efficient gradient-free divide-and-conquer
algorithm, which uses monotonicity arguments to generate valid bounds from the
recursive calls, and eliminate linking constraints based on the information
from sub-problems. This algorithm does not need strict convexity or
differentiability. It produces an $\epsilon$-approximate solution for the
continuous version of the problem in $\mathcal{O}(n \log m \log \frac{n
B}{\epsilon})$ operations and an integer solution in $\mathcal{O}(n \log m \log
B)$, where $n$ is the number of decision variables, $m$ is the number of
constraints, and $B$ is the resource bound. A complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n \log
m)$ is also achieved for the linear and quadratic cases. These are the best
complexities known to date for this important problem class. Our experimental
analyses confirm the practical performance of the method, which produces
optimal solutions for problems with up to 1,000,000 variables in a few seconds.
Promising applications to the support vector ordinal regression problem are
also investigated.
