Title: Large-Alphabet Encoding Schemes for Floodlight Quantum Key Distribution
Abstract: Floodlight quantum key distribution (FL-QKD) uses binary phase-shift keying
(BPSK) of multiple optical modes to achieve Gbps secret-key rates (SKRs) at
metropolitan-area distances. We show that FL-QKD's SKR can be doubled by using
32-ary PSK.
