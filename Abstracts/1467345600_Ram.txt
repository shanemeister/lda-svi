Title: Precise and diffraction-limited waveguide-to-free-space focusing  gratings
Abstract: We present the design and characterization of waveguide grating devices that
couple visible-wavelength light at $\lambda=674$ nm from single-mode, high
index-contrast dielectric waveguides to free-space beams forming micron-scale
diffraction-limited spots a designed distance and angle from the grating. With
a view to application in spatially-selective optical addressing, and in
contrast to previous work on similar devices, deviations from the main Gaussian
lobe up to $25$ microns from the focus and down to the $5\times10^{-6}$ level
in relative intensity are characterized as well; we show that along one
dimension the intensity of these weak sidelobes approaches the limit imposed by
diffraction from the finite field extent in the grating region. Additionally,
we characterize the polarization purity in the focal region, observing at the
center of the focus a low impurity $< 3 \times 10^{-4}$ in relative intensity.
Our approach allows quick, intuitive design of devices with such performance,
which may be applied in trapped-ion quantum information processing and
generally in any systems requiring optical routing to or from objects 10s--100s
of microns from a chip surface, but benefitting from the parallelism and
density of planar-fabricated dielectric integrated optics.
