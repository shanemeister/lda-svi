Title: Aspect-augmented Adversarial Networks for Domain Adaptation
Abstract: We introduce a neural method for transfer learning between two (source and
target) classification tasks or aspects over the same domain. Instead of target
labels, we assume a few keywords pertaining to source and target aspects
indicating sentence relevance rather than document class labels. Documents are
encoded by learning to embed and softly select relevant sentences in an
aspect-dependent manner. A shared classifier is trained on the source encoded
documents and labels, and applied to target encoded documents. We ensure
transfer through aspect-adversarial training so that encoded documents are, as
sets, aspect-invariant. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach
outperforms different baselines and model variants on two datasets, yielding an
improvement of 24% on a pathology dataset and 5% on a review dataset.
