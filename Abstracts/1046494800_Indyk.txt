Title: When Crossings Count - Approximating the Minimum Spanning Tree
Abstract: In the first part of the paper, we present an (1+\mu)-approximation algorithm
to the minimum-spanning tree of points in a planar arrangement of lines, where
the metric is the number of crossings between the spanning tree and the lines.
The expected running time is O((n/\mu^5) alpha^3(n) log^5 n), where \mu > 0 is
a prescribed constant.
In the second part of our paper, we show how to embed such a crossing metric,
into high-dimensions, so that the distances are preserved. As a result, we can
deploy a large collection of subquadratic approximations algorithms \cite
im-anntr-98,giv-rahdg-99 for problems involving points with the crossing metric
as a distance function. Applications include matching, clustering,
nearest-neighbor, and furthest-neighbor.
