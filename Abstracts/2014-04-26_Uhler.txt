Title: Faithfulness and learning hypergraphs from discrete distributions
Abstract: The concepts of faithfulness and strong-faithfulness are important for
statistical learning of graphical models. Graphs are not sufficient for
describing the association structure of a discrete distribution. Hypergraphs
representing hierarchical log-linear models are considered instead, and the
concept of parametric (strong-) faithfulness with respect to a hypergraph is
introduced. Strong-faithfulness ensures the existence of uniformly consistent
parameter estimators and enables building uniformly consistent procedures for a
hypergraph search. The strength of association in a discrete distribution can
be quantified with various measures, leading to different concepts of
strong-faithfulness. Lower and upper bounds for the proportions of
distributions that do not satisfy strong-faithfulness are computed for
different parameterizations and measures of association.
