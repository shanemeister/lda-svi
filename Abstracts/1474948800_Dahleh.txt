Title: Battery Capacity of Deferrable Energy Demand
Abstract: We investigate the ability of a homogeneous collection of deferrable energy
loads to behave as a battery; that is, to absorb and release energy in a
controllable fashion up to fixed and predetermined limits on volume, charge
rate and discharge rate. We derive bounds on the battery capacity that can be
realized and show that there are fundamental trade-offs between battery
parameters. By characterizing the state trajectories under scheduling policies
that emulate two illustrative batteries, we show that the trade-offs occur
because the states that allow the loads to absorb and release energy at high
aggregate rates are conflicting.
