Title: Scalable Superconducting Architecture for Adiabatic Quantum Computation
Abstract: A scalable superconducting architecture for adiabatic quantum computers is
proposed. The architecture is based on time-independent, nearest-neighbor
interqubit couplings: it can handle any problem in the class NP even in the
presence of measurement errors, noise, and decoherence. The implementation of
this architecture with superconducting persistent-current qubits and the
natural robustness of such an implementation to manufacturing imprecision and
decoherence are discussed.
