Title: Experimental fast quantum random number generation using  high-dimensional entanglement with entropy monitoring
Abstract: A quantum random number generator (QRNG) generates genuine randomness from
the intrinsic probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. The central problems
for most QRNGs are estimating the entropy of the genuine randomness and
producing such randomness at high rates. Here we propose and demonstrate a
proof-of-concept QRNG that operates at a high rate of 24 Mbit/s by means of a
high-dimensional entanglement system, in which the user monitors the entropy in
real time via the observation of a nonlocal quantum interference, without a
detailed characterization of the devices. Our work provides an important
approach to a robust QRNG with trusted but error-prone devices.
