Title: A Fast Distributed Proximal-Gradient Method
Abstract: We present a distributed proximal-gradient method for optimizing the average
of convex functions, each of which is the private local objective of an agent
in a network with time-varying topology. The local objectives have distinct
differentiable components, but they share a common nondifferentiable component,
which has a favorable structure suitable for effective computation of the
proximal operator. In our method, each agent iteratively updates its estimate
of the global minimum by optimizing its local objective function, and
exchanging estimates with others via communication in the network. Using
Nesterov-type acceleration techniques and multiple communication steps per
iteration, we show that this method converges at the rate 1/k (where k is the
number of communication rounds between the agents), which is faster than the
convergence rate of the existing distributed methods for solving this problem.
The superior convergence rate of our method is also verified by numerical
experiments.
