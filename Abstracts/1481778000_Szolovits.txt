Title: Neural Networks for Joint Sentence Classification in Medical Paper  Abstracts
Abstract: Existing models based on artificial neural networks (ANNs) for sentence
classification often do not incorporate the context in which sentences appear,
and classify sentences individually. However, traditional sentence
classification approaches have been shown to greatly benefit from jointly
classifying subsequent sentences, such as with conditional random fields. In
this work, we present an ANN architecture that combines the effectiveness of
typical ANN models to classify sentences in isolation, with the strength of
structured prediction. Our model achieves state-of-the-art results on two
different datasets for sequential sentence classification in medical abstracts.
