Title: Unifying Framework for Crowd-sourcing via Graphon Estimation
Abstract: We consider the question of inferring true answers associated with tasks
based on potentially noisy answers obtained through a micro-task crowd-sourcing
platform such as Amazon Mechanical Turk. We propose a generic, non-parametric
model for this setting: for a given task $i$, $1\leq i \leq T$, the response of
worker $j$, $1\leq j\leq W$ for this task is correct with probability $F_{ij}$,
where matrix $F = [F_{ij}]_{i\leq T, j\leq W}$ may satisfy one of a collection
of regularity conditions including low rank, which can express the popular
Dawid-Skene model; piecewise constant, which occurs when there is finitely many
worker and task types; monotonic under permutation, when there is some ordering
of worker skills and task difficulties; or Lipschitz with respect to an
associated latent non-parametric function. This model, contains most, if not
all, of the previously proposed models to the best of our knowledge.
We show that the question of estimating the true answers to tasks can be
reduced to solving the Graphon estimation problem, for which there has been
much recent progress. By leveraging these techniques, we provide a
crowdsourcing inference algorithm along with theoretical bounds on the fraction
of incorrectly estimated tasks. Subsequently, we have a solution for inferring
the true answers for tasks using noisy answers collected from crowd-sourcing
platform under a significantly larger class of models. Concretely, we establish
that if the $(i,j)$th element of $F$, $F_{ij}$, is equal to a Lipschitz
continuous function over latent features associated with the task $i$ and
worker $j$ for all $i, j$, then all task answers can be inferred correctly with
high probability by soliciting $\tilde{O}(\ln(T)^{3/2})$ responses per task
even without any knowledge of the Lipschitz function, task and worker features,
or the matrix $F$.
