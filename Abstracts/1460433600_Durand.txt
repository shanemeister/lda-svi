Title: What do different evaluation metrics tell us about saliency models?
Abstract: How best to evaluate a saliency model's ability to predict where humans look
in images is an open research question. The choice of evaluation metric depends
on how saliency is defined and how the ground truth is represented. Metrics
differ in how they rank saliency models, and this results from how false
positives and false negatives are treated, whether viewing biases are accounted
for, whether spatial deviations are factored in, and how the saliency maps are
pre-processed. In this paper, we provide an analysis of 8 different evaluation
metrics and their properties. With the help of systematic experiments and
visualizations of metric computations, we add interpretability to saliency
scores and more transparency to the evaluation of saliency models. Building off
the differences in metric properties and behaviors, we make recommendations for
metric selections under specific assumptions and for specific applications.
