Title: Truncated Random Measures
Abstract: Completely random measures (CRMs) and their normalizations are a rich source
of Bayesian nonparametric priors. Examples include the beta, gamma, and
Dirichlet processes. In this paper we detail two major classes of sequential
CRM representations---series representations and superposition
representations---within which we organize both novel and existing sequential
representations that can be used for simulation and posterior inference. These
two classes and their constituent representations subsume existing ones that
have previously been developed in an ad hoc manner for specific processes.
Since a complete infinite-dimensional CRM cannot be used explicitly for
computation, sequential representations are often truncated for tractability.
We provide truncation error analyses for each type of sequential
representation, as well as their normalized versions, thereby generalizing and
improving upon existing truncation error bounds in the literature. We analyze
the computational complexity of the sequential representations, which in
conjunction with our error bounds allows us to directly compare representations
and discuss their relative efficiency. We include numerous applications of our
theoretical results to commonly-used (normalized) CRMs, demonstrating that our
results enable a straightforward representation and analysis of CRMs that has
not previously been available in a Bayesian nonparametric context.
