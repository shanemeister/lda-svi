Title: A Portable, 3D-Printing Enabled Multi-Vehicle Platform for Robotics  Research and Education
Abstract: microMVP is an affordable, portable, and open source micro-scale mobile robot
platform designed for robotics research and education. As a complete and unique
multi-vehicle platform enabled by 3D printing and the maker culture, microMVP
can be easily reproduced and requires little maintenance: a set of six micro
vehicles, each measuring $8\times 5\times 6$ cubic centimeters and weighing
under $100$ grams, and the accompanying tracking platform can be fully
assembled in under two hours, all from readily available components. In this
paper, we describe microMVP's hardware and software architecture, and the
design thoughts that go into the making of the platform. The capabilities of
microMVP APIs are then demonstrated with several single- and multi-robot path
and motion planning algorithms. microMVP supports all common operation systems.
