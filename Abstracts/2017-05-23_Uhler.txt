Title: Patchnet: Interpretable Neural Networks for Image Classification
Abstract: The ability to visually understand and interpret learned features from
complex predictive models is crucial for their acceptance in sensitive areas
such as health care. To move closer to this goal of truly interpretable complex
models, we present PatchNet, a network that restricts global context for image
classification tasks in order to easily provide visual representations of
learned texture features on a predetermined local scale. We demonstrate how
PatchNet provides visual heatmap representations of the learned features, and
we mathematically analyze the behavior of the network during convergence. We
also present a version of PatchNet that is particularly well suited for
lowering false positive rates in image classification tasks. We apply PatchNet
to the classification of textures from the Describable Textures Dataset and to
the ISBI-ISIC 2016 melanoma classification challenge.
