Title: Formal Verification of Hardware Synthesis
Abstract: We report on the implementation of a certified compiler for a high-level
hardware description language (HDL) called Fe-Si (FEatherweight SynthesIs).
Fe-Si is a simplified version of Bluespec, an HDL based on a notion of guarded
atomic actions. Fe-Si is defined as a dependently typed deep embedding in Coq.
The target language of the compiler corresponds to a synthesisable subset of
Verilog or VHDL. A key aspect of our approach is that input programs to the
compiler can be defined and proved correct inside Coq. Then, we use extraction
and a Verilog back-end (written in OCaml) to get a certified version of a
hardware design.
