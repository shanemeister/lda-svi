Title: Semidefinite descriptions of the convex hull of rotation matrices
Abstract: We study the convex hull of $SO(n)$, thought of as the set of $n\times n$
orthogonal matrices with unit determinant, from the point of view of
semidefinite programming. We show that the convex hull of $SO(n)$ is doubly
spectrahedral, i.e. both it and its polar have a description as the
intersection of a cone of positive semidefinite matrices with an affine
subspace. Our spectrahedral representations are explicit, and are of minimum
size, in the sense that there are no smaller spectrahedral representations of
these convex bodies.
