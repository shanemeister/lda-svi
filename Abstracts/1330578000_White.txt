Title: Fluctuating Surface Currents: A New Algorithm for Efficient Prediction  of Casimir Interactions among Arbitrary Materials in Arbitrary Geometries. I.  Theory
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for the efficient numerical computation of
Casimir interactions between objects of arbitrary geometries, composed of
materials with arbitrary frequency-dependent electrical properties. Our method
formulates the Casimir effect as an interaction between effective electric and
magnetic current distributions on the surfaces of material bodies, and obtains
Casimir energies, forces, and torques from the spectral properties of a matrix
that quantifies the interactions of these surface currents. The method can be
formulated and understood in two distinct ways: \textbf{(1)} as a consequence
of the familiar \textit{stress-tensor} approach to Casimir physics, or,
alternatively, \textbf{(2)} as a particular case of the \textit{path-integral}
approach to Casimir physics, and we present both formulations in full detail.
In addition to providing an algorithm for computing Casimir interactions in
geometries that could not be efficiently handled by any other method, the
framework proposed here thus achieves an explicit unification of two seemingly
disparate approaches to computational Casimir physics.
