Title: A Decomposition Algorithm for Nested Resource Allocation Problems
Abstract: We propose an exact polynomial algorithm for a resource allocation problem
with convex costs and constraints on partial sums of resource consumptions, in
the presence of either continuous or integer variables. No assumption of strict
convexity or differentiability is needed. The method solves a hierarchy of
resource allocation subproblems, whose solutions are used to convert
constraints on sums of resources into bounds for separate variables at higher
levels. The resulting time complexity for the integer problem is $O(n \log m
\log (B/n))$, and the complexity of obtaining an $\epsilon$-approximate
solution for the continuous case is $O(n \log m \log (B/\epsilon))$, $n$ being
the number of variables, $m$ the number of ascending constraints (such that $m
< n$), $\epsilon$ a desired precision, and $B$ the total resource. This
algorithm attains the best-known complexity when $m = n$, and improves it when
$\log m = o(\log n)$. Extensive experimental analyses are conducted with four
recent algorithms on various continuous problems issued from theory and
practice. The proposed method achieves a higher performance than previous
algorithms, addressing all problems with up to one million variables in less
than one minute on a modern computer.
