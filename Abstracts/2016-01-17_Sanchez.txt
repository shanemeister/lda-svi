Title: Criteria for directly detecting topological Fermi arcs in Weyl  semimetals
Abstract: The recent discovery of the first Weyl semimetal in TaAs provides the first
observation of a Weyl fermion in nature and demonstrates a novel type of
anomalous surface state, the Fermi arc. Like topological insulators, the bulk
topological invariants of a Weyl semimetal are uniquely fixed by the surface
states of a bulk sample. Here, we present a set of distinct conditions,
accessible by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), each of which
demonstrates topological Fermi arcs in a surface state band structure, with
minimal reliance on calculation. We apply these results to TaAs and NbP. For
the first time, we rigorously demonstrate a non-zero Chern number in TaAs by
counting chiral edge modes on a closed loop. We further show that it is
unreasonable to directly observe Fermi arcs in NbP by ARPES within available
experimental resolution and spectral linewidth. Our results are general and
apply to any new material to demonstrate a Weyl semimetal.
