Title: Convergence Rate of Distributed ADMM over Networks
Abstract: We propose a distributed algorithm based on Alternating Direction Method of
Multipliers (ADMM) to minimize the sum of locally known convex functions using
communication over a network. This optimization problem emerges in many
applications in distributed machine learning and statistical estimation. We
show that when functions are convex, both the objective function values and the
feasibility violation converge with rate $O(\frac{1}{T})$, where $T$ is the
number of iterations. We then show that if the functions are strongly convex
and have Lipschitz continuous gradients, the sequence generated by our
algorithm converges linearly to the optimal solution. In particular, an
$\epsilon$-optimal solution can be computed with $O(\sqrt{\kappa_f} \log
(1/\epsilon))$ iterations, where $\kappa_f$ is the condition number of the
problem. Our analysis also highlights the effect of network structure on the
convergence rate through maximum and minimum degree of nodes as well as the
algebraic connectivity of the network.
