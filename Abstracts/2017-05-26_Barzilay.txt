Title: Style Transfer from Non-Parallel Text by Cross-Alignment
Abstract: This paper focuses on style transfer on the basis of non-parallel text. This
is an instance of a broader family of problems including machine translation,
decipherment, and sentiment modification. The key technical challenge is to
separate the content from desired text characteristics such as sentiment. We
leverage refined alignment of latent representations across mono-lingual text
corpora with different characteristics. We deliberately modify encoded examples
according to their characteristics, requiring the reproduced instances to match
available examples with the altered characteristics as a population. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of this cross-alignment method on three tasks:
sentiment modification, decipherment of word substitution ciphers, and recovery
of word order.
