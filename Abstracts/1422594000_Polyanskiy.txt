Title: Joint source-channel coding with feedback
Abstract: This paper quantifies the fundamental limits of variable-length transmission
of a general (possibly analog) source over a memoryless channel with noiseless
feedback, under a distortion constraint. We consider excess distortion, average
distortion and guaranteed distortion ($d$-semifaithful codes). In contrast to
the asymptotic fundamental limit, a general conclusion is that allowing
variable-length codes and feedback leads to a sizable improvement in the
fundamental delay-distortion tradeoff. In addition, we investigate the minimum
energy required to reproduce $k$ source samples with a given fidelity after
transmission over a memoryless Gaussian channel, and we show that the required
minimum energy is reduced with feedback and an average (rather than maximal)
power constraint.
