Title: A Polylogarithmic-Competitive Algorithm for the k-Server Problem
Abstract: We give the first polylogarithmic-competitive randomized online algorithm for
the $k$-server problem on an arbitrary finite metric space. In particular, our
algorithm achieves a competitive ratio of O(log^3 n log^2 k log log n) for any
metric space on n points. Our algorithm improves upon the deterministic
(2k-1)-competitive algorithm of Koutsoupias and Papadimitriou [J.ACM'95]
whenever n is sub-exponential in k.
