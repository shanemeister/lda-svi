Title: Counting Markov Equivalence Classes by Number of Immoralities
Abstract: Two directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are called Markov equivalent if and only
if they have the same underlying undirected graph (i.e. skeleton) and the same
set of immoralities. Using observational data, a DAG model can only be
determined up to Markov equivalence, and so it is desirable to understand the
size and number of Markov equivalence classes (MECs) combinatorially. In this
paper, we address this enumerative question using a pair of generating
functions that encode the number and size of MECs on a skeleton $G$, and in
doing so we connect this problem to classical problems in combinatorial
optimization. The first is a graph polynomial that counts the number of MECs on
$G$ by their number of immoralities. Using connections to the independent set
problem, we show that computing a DAG on $G$ with the maximum possible number
of immoralities is NP-hard. The second generating function counts the MECs on
$G$ according to their size. Via computer enumeration, we show that this
generating function is distinct for every connected graph on $p$ nodes for all
$p\leq 10$.
