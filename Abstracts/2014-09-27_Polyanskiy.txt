Title: Upper bound on list-decoding radius of binary codes
Abstract: Consider the problem of packing Hamming balls of a given relative radius
subject to the constraint that they cover any point of the ambient Hamming
space with multiplicity at most $L$. For odd $L\ge 3$ an asymptotic upper bound
on the rate of any such packing is proven. Resulting bound improves the best
known bound (due to Blinovsky'1986) for rates below a certain threshold. Method
is a superposition of the linear-programming idea of Ashikhmin, Barg and Litsyn
(that was used previously to improve the estimates of Blinovsky for $L=2$) and
a Ramsey-theoretic technique of Blinovsky. As an application it is shown that
for all odd $L$ the slope of the rate-radius tradeoff is zero at zero rate.
