Title: Canonical Estimation in a Rare-Events Regime
Abstract: We propose a general methodology for performing statistical inference within
a `rare-events regime' that was recently suggested by Wagner, Viswanath and
Kulkarni. Our approach allows one to easily establish consistent estimators for
a very large class of canonical estimation problems, in a large alphabet
setting. These include the problems studied in the original paper, such as
entropy and probability estimation, in addition to many other interesting ones.
We particularly illustrate this approach by consistently estimating the size of
the alphabet and the range of the probabilities. We start by proposing an
abstract methodology based on constructing a probability measure with the
desired asymptotic properties. We then demonstrate two concrete constructions
by casting the Good-Turing estimator as a pseudo-empirical measure, and by
using the theory of mixture model estimation.
