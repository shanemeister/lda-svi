Title: The MOSDEF survey: the prevalence and properties of galaxy-wide  AGN-driven outflows at $z\sim 2$
Abstract: Using observations from the first two years of the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution
Field (MOSDEF) survey, we study 13 AGN-driven outflows detected from a sample
of 67 X-ray, IR and/or optically selected AGN at $z \sim 2$. The AGN in the
sample have bolometric luminosities spanning $10^{44}-10^{46} \mathrm{erg
s^{-1}}$, including both quasars and more common, moderate-luminosity AGN. We
detect signatures of blueshifted, ionized gas outflows in the \hbeta , [OIII],
\halpha and/or [NII] emission lines of 19\% of the AGN, while only 1.8\% of the
MOSDEF galaxies have similar outflows detected. The outflow velocities range
from 300 to 1000 km s$^{-1}$. Eight of the 13 detected outflows are spatially
extended on similar scales as the host galaxies, with spatial extents of 2.5 to
11.0 kpc along the MOSFIRE slits. Outflows are detected uniformly across the
galaxy star-forming main sequence, showing little trend with the stellar mass
or SFR of the host galaxy. Line ratio diagnostics in the BPT diagram indicate
that the outflowing gas is photoionized by the AGN. We do not find evidence for
positive AGN feedback, either in our relatively small MOSDEF sample or in a
much larger sample from SDSS. Analysis of the mass and energy outflow rates in
the MOSDEF AGN indicates that stellar feedback is likely insufficient to drive
these outflows at $z \sim 2$ and that they are very likely to be AGN-driven.
The outflows have mass-loading factors of $\sim 1-5$, suggesting that they help
regulate star formation in their host galaxies, though they may not be
sufficient to fully quench it.
