Title: The necessity and sufficiency of anytime capacity for stabilization of a  linear system over a noisy communication link Part I: scalar systems
Abstract: We review how Shannon's classical notion of capacity is not enough to
characterize a noisy communication channel if the channel is intended to be
used as part of a feedback loop to stabilize an unstable scalar linear system.
While classical capacity is not enough, another sense of capacity (parametrized
by reliability) called ``anytime capacity'' is shown to be necessary for the
stabilization of an unstable process. The required rate is given by the log of
the unstable system gain and the required reliability comes from the sense of
stability desired. A consequence of this necessity result is a sequential
generalization of the Schalkwijk/Kailath scheme for communication over the AWGN
channel with feedback.
In cases of sufficiently rich information patterns between the encoder and
decoder, adequate anytime capacity is also shown to be sufficient for there to
exist a stabilizing controller. These sufficiency results are then generalized
to cases with noisy observations, delayed control actions, and without any
explicit feedback between the observer and the controller. Both necessary and
sufficient conditions are extended to continuous time systems as well. We close
with comments discussing a hierarchy of difficulty for communication problems
and how these results establish where stabilization problems sit in that
hierarchy.
