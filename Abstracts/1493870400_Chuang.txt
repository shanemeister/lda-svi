Title: Learning with Confident Examples: Rank Pruning for Robust Classification  with Noisy Labels
Abstract: Noisy PN learning is the problem of binary classification when training
examples may be mislabeled (flipped) uniformly with noise rate rho1 for
positive examples and rho0 for negative examples. We propose Rank Pruning (RP)
to solve noisy PN learning and the open problem of estimating the noise rates.
Unlike prior solutions, RP is efficient and general, requiring O(T) for any
unrestricted choice of probabilistic classifier with T fitting time. We prove
RP achieves consistent noise estimation and equivalent empirical risk as
learning with uncorrupted labels in ideal conditions, and derive closed-form
solutions when conditions are non-ideal. RP achieves state-of-the-art noise
rate estimation and F1, error, and AUC-PR on the MNIST and CIFAR datasets,
regardless of noise rates. To highlight, RP with a CNN classifier can predict
if a MNIST digit is a "1" or "not 1" with only 0.25% error, and 0.46% error
across all digits, even when 50% of positive examples are mislabeled and 50% of
observed positive labels are mislabeled negative examples.
