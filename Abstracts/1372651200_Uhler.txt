Title: Learning directed acyclic graphs based on sparsest permutations
Abstract: We consider the problem of learning a Bayesian network or directed acyclic
graph (DAG) model from observational data. A number of constraint-based,
score-based and hybrid algorithms have been developed for this purpose. For
constraint-based methods, statistical consistency guarantees typically rely on
the faithfulness assumption, which has been show to be restrictive especially
for graphs with cycles in the skeleton. However, there is only limited work on
consistency guarantees for score-based and hybrid algorithms and it has been
unclear whether consistency guarantees can be proven under weaker conditions
than the faithfulness assumption.
In this paper, we propose the sparsest permutation (SP) algorithm. This
algorithm is based on finding the causal ordering of the variables that yields
the sparsest DAG. We prove that this new score-based method is consistent under
strictly weaker conditions than the faithfulness assumption. We also
demonstrate through simulations on small DAGs that the SP algorithm compares
favorably to the constraint-based PC and SGS algorithms as well as the
score-based Greedy Equivalence Search and hybrid Max-Min Hill-Climbing method.
In the Gaussian setting, we prove that our algorithm boils down to finding the
permutation of the variables with sparsest Cholesky decomposition for the
inverse covariance matrix. Using this connection, we show that in the oracle
setting, where the true covariance matrix is known, the SP algorithm is in fact
equivalent to $\ell_0$-penalized maximum likelihood estimation.
