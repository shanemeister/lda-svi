Title: Efficient Redundancy Techniques for Latency Reduction in Cloud Systems
Abstract: In cloud computing systems, assigning a task to multiple servers and waiting
for the earliest copy to finish is an effective method to combat the
variability in response time of individual servers, and reduce latency. But
adding redundancy may result in higher cost of computing resources, as well as
an increase in queueing delay due to higher traffic load. This work helps
understand when and how redundancy gives a cost-efficient reduction in latency.
For a general task service time distribution, we compare different redundancy
strategies in terms of the number of redundant tasks, and time when they are
issued and canceled. We get the insight that the log-concavity of the task
service time creates a dichotomy of when adding redundancy helps. If the
service time distribution is log-convex (i.e. log of the tail probability is
convex) then adding maximum redundancy reduces both latency and cost. And if it
is log-concave (i.e. log of the tail probability is concave), then less
redundancy, and early cancellation of redundant tasks is more effective. Using
these insights, we design a general redundancy strategy that achieves a good
latency-cost trade-off for an arbitrary service time distribution. This work
also generalizes and extends some results in the analysis of fork-join queues.
