Title: Edge detection based on morphological amoebas
Abstract: Detecting the edges of objects within images is critical for quality image
processing. We present an edge-detecting technique that uses morphological
amoebas that adjust their shape based on variation in image contours. We
evaluate the method both quantitatively and qualitatively for edge detection of
images, and compare it to classic morphological methods. Our amoeba-based
edge-detection system performed better than the classic edge detectors.
