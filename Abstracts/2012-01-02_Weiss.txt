Title: Scikit-learn: Machine Learning in Python
Abstract: Scikit-learn is a Python module integrating a wide range of state-of-the-art
machine learning algorithms for medium-scale supervised and unsupervised
problems. This package focuses on bringing machine learning to non-specialists
using a general-purpose high-level language. Emphasis is put on ease of use,
performance, documentation, and API consistency. It has minimal dependencies
and is distributed under the simplified BSD license, encouraging its use in
both academic and commercial settings. Source code, binaries, and documentation
can be downloaded from this http URL
