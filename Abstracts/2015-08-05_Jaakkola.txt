Title: Structured Prediction: From Gaussian Perturbations to Linear-Time  Principled Algorithms
Abstract: Margin-based structured prediction commonly uses a maximum loss over all
possible structured outputs \cite{Altun03,Collins04b,Taskar03}. In natural
language processing, recent work \cite{Zhang14,Zhang15} has proposed the use of
the maximum loss over random structured outputs sampled independently from some
proposal distribution. This method is linear-time in the number of random
structured outputs and trivially parallelizable. We study this family of loss
functions in the PAC-Bayes framework under Gaussian perturbations
\cite{McAllester07}. Under some technical conditions and up to statistical
accuracy, we show that this family of loss functions produces a tighter upper
bound of the Gibbs decoder distortion than commonly used methods. Thus, using
the maximum loss over random structured outputs is a principled way of learning
the parameter of structured prediction models. Besides explaining the
experimental success of \cite{Zhang14,Zhang15}, our theoretical results show
that more general techniques are possible.
