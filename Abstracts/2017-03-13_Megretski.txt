Title: Inverse Stability Problem and Applications to Renewables Integration
Abstract: In modern power systems, the operating point, at which the demand and supply
are balanced, continuously changes in an unpredictable way due to the natural
fluctuation of loads and intermittent renewable generations increasingly
installed into the system. Understanding the dynamics of power systems with
varying operating point would be essential to the reliable operation of power
systems, and possibly allow higher integration of renewable generations. In
this letter, we formulate, for the first time, the inverse stability problem of
power systems, which concerns with characterizing the region of equilibrium
points (EPs) that the system can reach from a given initial state. The inverse
stability is rarely addressed in control systems theory, and thus, poorly
understood. Exploiting quadratic bounds of the system's energy function, we
introduce an estimate for the EP region. Also, we briefly describe three
important applications of this inverse stability certificate: (i) robust
stability assessment of power systems with respect to renewable generations,
(ii) stability-constrained optimal power flow (sOPF), and (iii)
stability-guaranteed corrective actions.
