Title: Informational Braess' Paradox: The Effect of Information on Traffic  Congestion
Abstract: To systematically study the implications of additional information about
routes provided to certain users (e.g., via GPS-based route guidance systems),
we introduce a new class of congestion games in which users have differing
information sets about the available edges and can only use routes consisting
of edges in their information set. After defining the notion of Information
Constrained Wardrop Equilibrium (ICWE) for this class of congestion games and
studying its basic properties, we turn to our main focus: whether additional
information can be harmful (in the sense of generating greater equilibrium
costs/delays). We formulate this question in the form of Informational Braess'
Paradox (IBP), which extends the classic Braess' Paradox in traffic equilibria,
and asks whether users receiving additional information can become worse off.
We provide a comprehensive answer to this question showing that in any network
in the series of linearly independent (SLI) class, which is a strict subset of
series-parallel network, IBP cannot occur, and in any network that is not in
the SLI class, there exists a configuration of edge-specific cost functions for
which IBP will occur. In the process, we establish several properties of the
SLI class of networks, which are comprised of linearly independent networks
joined together. These properties include the characterization of the
complement of the SLI class in terms of embedding a specific set of subgraphs,
and also show that whether a graph is SLI can be determined in linear time. We
further prove that the worst-case inefficiency performance of ICWE is no worse
than the standard Wardrop Equilibrium with one type of users.
