Title: Exact goodness-of-fit testing for the Ising model
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the simplest and most famous models of interacting
systems. It was originally proposed to model ferromagnetic interactions in
statistical physics and is now widely used to model spatial processes in many
areas such as ecology, sociology, and genetics, usually without testing its
goodness of fit. Here, we propose various test statistics and an exact
goodness-of-fit test for the finite-lattice Ising model. The theory of Markov
bases has been developed in algebraic statistics for exact goodness-of-fit
testing using a Monte Carlo approach. However, finding a Markov basis is often
computationally intractable. Thus, we develop a Monte Carlo method for exact
goodness-of-fit testing for the Ising model which avoids computing a Markov
basis and also leads to a better connectivity of the Markov chain and hence to
a faster convergence. We show how this method can be applied to analyze the
spatial organization of receptors on the cell membrane.
