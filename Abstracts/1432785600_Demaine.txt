Title: New Geometric Algorithms for Fully Connected Staged Self-Assembly
Abstract: We consider staged self-assembly systems, in which square-shaped tiles can be
added to bins in several stages. Within these bins, the tiles may connect to
each other, depending on the glue types of their edges. Previous work by
Demaine et al. showed that a relatively small number of tile types suffices to
produce arbitrary shapes in this model. However, these constructions were only
based on a spanning tree of the geometric shape, so they did not produce full
connectivity of the underlying grid graph in the case of shapes with holes;
designing fully connected assemblies with a polylogarithmic number of stages
was left as a major open problem. We resolve this challenge by presenting new
systems for staged assembly that produce fully connected polyominoes in O(log^2
n) stages, for various scale factors and temperature {\tau} = 2 as well as
{\tau} = 1. Our constructions work even for shapes with holes and uses only a
constant number of glues and tiles. Moreover, the underlying approach is more
geometric in nature, implying that it promised to be more feasible for shapes
with compact geometric description.
