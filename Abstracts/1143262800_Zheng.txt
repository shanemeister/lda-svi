Title: A SIMO Fiber Aided Wireless Network Architecture
Abstract: The concept of a fiber aided wireless network architecture (FAWNA) is
introduced in [Ray et al., Allerton Conference 2005], which allows high-speed
mobile connectivity by leveraging the speed of optical networks. In this paper,
we consider a single-input, multiple-output (SIMO) FAWNA, which consists of a
SIMO wireless channel and an optical fiber channel, connected through
wireless-optical interfaces. We propose a scheme where the received wireless
signal at each interface is quantized and sent over the fiber. Though our
architecture is similar to that of the classical CEO problem, our problem is
different from it. We show that the capacity of our scheme approaches the
capacity of the architecture, exponentially with fiber capacity. We also show
that for a given fiber capacity, there is an optimal operating wireless
bandwidth and an optimal number of wireless-optical interfaces. The
wireless-optical interfaces of our scheme have low complexity and do not
require knowledge of the transmitter code book. They are also extendable to
FAWNAs with large number of transmitters and interfaces and, offer adaptability
to variable rates, changing channel conditions and node positions.
