Title: Context-Aware System Synthesis, Task Assignment, and Routing
Abstract: The design and organization of complex computational systems, such as those
found in robots, traditionally requires laborious trial-and-error processes to
ensure components are correctly connected with necessary resources for
computation. This paper presents a novel generalization of the quadratic
assignment and routing problem, introducing formalizations for selecting
components and interconnections to synthesize a complete system capable of
providing some user-defined functionality. By introducing problem context,
functional requirements, and modularity directly into the assignment problem,
optimal systems can be automatically generated while respecting constraints on
bandwidth and computational resources. The ability to generate complete
functional systems reduces manual design effort by allowing for a guided
exploration of the design space, and increases resiliency by quantifying
resource margins and enabling adaptation of system structure in response to
changing environments, hardware or software failure. The proposed formulation
is cast as an integer linear program which is provably $\mathcal{NP}$-hard.
Several case studies explore the capabilities in designing several complex
robot systems, highlighting the expressiveness and scale of problems
addressable by this approach. Numerical simulations quantify real world
performance and demonstrate tractable time complexity for the scale of problems
encountered in many modern robotic systems.
