Title: SegICP: Integrated Deep Semantic Segmentation and Pose Estimation
Abstract: Recent robotic manipulation competitions have highlighted that sophisticated
robots still struggle to achieve fast and reliable perception of task-relevant
objects in complex, realistic scenarios. To improve these systems' perceptive
speed and robustness, we present SegICP, a novel integrated solution to object
recognition and pose estimation. SegICP couples convolutional neural networks
and multi-hypothesis point cloud registration to achieve both robust pixel-wise
semantic segmentation as well as accurate and real-time 6-DOF pose estimation
for relevant objects, even in the presence of occlusions and sensor noise. Our
architecture achieves 1cm position error and <5^\circ$ angle error in real time
without an initial seed. We evaluate and benchmark SegICP against an annotated
dataset generated by motion capture.
