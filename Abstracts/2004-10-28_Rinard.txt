Title: On Spatial Conjunction as Second-Order Logic
Abstract: Spatial conjunction is a powerful construct for reasoning about dynamically
allocated data structures, as well as concurrent, distributed and mobile
computation. While researchers have identified many uses of spatial
conjunction, its precise expressive power compared to traditional logical
constructs was not previously known. In this paper we establish the expressive
power of spatial conjunction. We construct an embedding from first-order logic
with spatial conjunction into second-order logic, and more surprisingly, an
embedding from full second order logic into first-order logic with spatial
conjunction. These embeddings show that the satisfiability of formulas in
first-order logic with spatial conjunction is equivalent to the satisfiability
of formulas in second-order logic. These results explain the great expressive
power of spatial conjunction and can be used to show that adding unrestricted
spatial conjunction to a decidable logic leads to an undecidable logic. As one
example, we show that adding unrestricted spatial conjunction to two-variable
logic leads to undecidability. On the side of decidability, the embedding into
second-order logic immediately implies the decidability of first-order logic
with a form of spatial conjunction over trees. The embedding into spatial
conjunction also has useful consequences: because a restricted form of spatial
conjunction in two-variable logic preserves decidability, we obtain that a
correspondingly restricted form of second-order quantification in two-variable
logic is decidable. The resulting language generalizes the first-order theory
of boolean algebra over sets and is useful in reasoning about the contents of
data structures in object-oriented languages.
