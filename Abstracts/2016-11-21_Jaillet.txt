Title: Structured Prediction by Conditional Risk Minimization
Abstract: We propose a general approach for supervised learning with structured output
spaces, such as combinatorial and polyhedral sets, that is based on minimizing
estimated conditional risk functions. Given a loss function defined over pairs
of output labels, we first estimate the conditional risk function by solving a
(possibly infinite) collection of regularized least squares problems. A
prediction is made by solving an inference problem that minimizes the estimated
conditional risk function over the output space. We show that this approach
enables, in some cases, efficient training and inference without explicitly
introducing a convex surrogate for the original loss function, even when it is
discontinuous. Empirical evaluations on real-world and synthetic data sets
demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in adapting to a variety of loss
functions.
