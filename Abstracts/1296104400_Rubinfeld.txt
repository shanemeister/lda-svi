Title: Approximating the Influence of a monotone Boolean function in  O(\sqrt{n}) query complexity
Abstract: The {\em Total Influence} ({\em Average Sensitivity) of a discrete function
is one of its fundamental measures. We study the problem of approximating the
total influence of a monotone Boolean function \ifnum\plusminus=1 $f:
\{\pm1\}^n \longrightarrow \{\pm1\}$, \else $f: \bitset^n \to \bitset$, \fi
which we denote by $I[f]$. We present a randomized algorithm that approximates
the influence of such functions to within a multiplicative factor of $(1\pm
\eps)$ by performing $O(\frac{\sqrt{n}\log n}{I[f]} \poly(1/\eps)) $ queries. %
\mnote{D: say something about technique?} We also prove a lower bound of %
$\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{n/\log n}}{I[f]})$ $\Omega(\frac{\sqrt{n}}{\log n \cdot
I[f]})$ on the query complexity of any constant-factor approximation algorithm
for this problem (which holds for $I[f] = \Omega(1)$), % and $I[f] =
O(\sqrt{n}/\log n)$), hence showing that our algorithm is almost optimal in
terms of its dependence on $n$. For general functions we give a lower bound of
$\Omega(\frac{n}{I[f]})$, which matches the complexity of a simple sampling
algorithm.
