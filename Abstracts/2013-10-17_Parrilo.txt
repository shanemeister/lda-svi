Title: SOSTOOLS Version 3.00 Sum of Squares Optimization Toolbox for MATLAB
Abstract: SOSTOOLS v3.00 is the latest release of the freely available MATLAB toolbox
for formulating and solving sum of squares (SOS) optimization problems. Such
problems arise naturally in the analysis and control of nonlinear dynamical
systems, but also in other areas such as combinatorial optimization. Highlights
of the new release include the ability to create polynomial matrices and
formulate polynomial matrix inequalities, compatibility with MuPAD, the new
MATLAB symbolic engine, as well as the multipoly toolbox v2.01. SOSTOOLS v3.00
can interface with five semidefinite programming solvers, and includes ten
demonstration examples.
