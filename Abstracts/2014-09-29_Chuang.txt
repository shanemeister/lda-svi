Title: Quantum imaging by coherent enhancement
Abstract: Conventional wisdom dictates that to image the position of fluorescent atoms
or molecules, one should stimulate as much emission and collect as many photons
as possible. That is, in this classical case, it has always been assumed that
the coherence time of the system should be made short, and that the statistical
scaling $\sim1/\sqrt{t}$ defines the resolution limit for imaging time $t$.
However, here we show in contrast that given the same resources, a long
coherence time permits a higher resolution image. In this quantum regime, we
give a procedure for determining the position of a single two-level system, and
demonstrate that the standard errors of our position estimates scale at the
Heisenberg limit as $\sim 1/t$, a quadratic, and notably optimal, improvement
over the classical case.
