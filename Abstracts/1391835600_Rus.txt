Title: Correlated Orienteering Problem and it Application to Persistent  Monitoring Tasks
Abstract: We propose a novel non-linear extension to the Orienteering Problem (OP),
called the Correlated Orienteering Problem (COP). We use COP to model the
planning of informative tours for the persistent monitoring of a spatiotemporal
field with time-invariant spatial correlations, in which the tours are
constrained to have limited length. Our focus in this paper is QCOP a quadratic
COP formulation that only looks at correlations between neighboring nodes in a
node network. The main feature of QCOP is a quadratic utility function
capturing the said spatial correlation. QCOP may be solved using mixed integer
quadratic programming (MIQP), with the resulting anytime algorithm capable of
planning multiple disjoint tours that maximize the quadratic utility. In
particular, our algorithm can quickly plan a near-optimal tour over a network
with up to $150$ nodes. Besides performing extensive simulation studies to
verify the algorithm's correctness and characterize its performance, we also
successfully applied it to two realistic persistent monitoring tasks: (i)
estimation over a synthetic spatiotemporal field, and (ii) estimating the
temperature distribution in the state of Massachusetts.
