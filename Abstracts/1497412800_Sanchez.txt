Title: Large Fermi Arcs in Unconventional Weyl Semimetal RhSi
Abstract: Chiral fermions in three-dimensional condensed matter systems display
dramatic examples of a topological bulk-boundary correspondence: the surface
projections of the bulk chiral nodes, typically conventional $C=\pm 1$ Weyl
fermions, appear connected by Fermi arcs. However, Weyl fermions have thus far
only been experimentally realized in narrowly separated pairs, for which the
Fermi arcs effects are weak. Recent works have introduced unconventional chiral
Fermions, including single threefold-degenerate and double sixfold-degenerate
spin-1 Weyl nodes. We report that in space group (SG) 198 $P2_{1}3$, the
absence of rotoinversions permits at Brillouin zone corner $R$ a
sixfold-degenerate double spin-1 Weyl point with nonzero Chern number.
Furthermore, using a simple tight-binding model, we demonstrate that the
minimal band connectivity of SG 198 displays this unconventional fermion, as
well as a previously uncharacterized fourfold-degenerate chiral fermion at
$\Gamma$. We perform first-principles electronic structure calculations
demonstrating RhSi as representative of this physics. We find that in RhSi
crystals, these two chiral fermions lie close to the Fermi energy and are
connected by an otherwise large bulk gap. Each unconventional fermion displays
Chern number $\pm4$ and their projections are connected by large surface Fermi
arcs. We conclude with an analysis of the modified bulk photogalvanic effect in
these unconventional Weyl semimetals.
