Title: Lower Bounds for Sparse Recovery
Abstract: We consider the following k-sparse recovery problem: design an m x n matrix
A, such that for any signal x, given Ax we can efficiently recover x'
satisfying
||x-x'||_1 <= C min_{k-sparse} x"} ||x-x"||_1.
It is known that there exist matrices A with this property that have only O(k
log (n/k)) rows.
In this paper we show that this bound is tight. Our bound holds even for the
more general /randomized/ version of the problem, where A is a random variable
and the recovery algorithm is required to work for any fixed x with constant
probability (over A).
