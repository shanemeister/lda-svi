Title: High-rate field demonstration of large-alphabet quantum key distribution
Abstract: Quantum key distribution (QKD) exploits the quantum nature of light to share
provably secure keys, allowing secure communication in the presence of an
eavesdropper. The first QKD schemes used photons encoded in two states, such as
polarization. Recently, much effort has turned to large-alphabet QKD schemes,
which encode photons in high-dimensional basis states. Compared to
binary-encoded QKD, large-alphabet schemes can encode more secure information
per detected photon, boosting secure communication rates, and also provide
increased resilience to noise and loss. High-dimensional encoding may also
improve the efficiency of other quantum information processing tasks, such as
performing Bell tests and implementing quantum gates. Here, we demonstrate a
large-alphabet QKD protocol based on high-dimensional temporal encoding. We
achieve record secret-key rates and perform the first field demonstration of
large-alphabet QKD. This demonstrates a new, practical way to optimize
secret-key rates and marks an important step towards transmission of
high-dimensional quantum states in deployed networks.
