Title: Differentially-Private Logistic Regression for Detecting Multiple-SNP  Association in GWAS Databases
Abstract: Following the publication of an attack on genome-wide association studies
(GWAS) data proposed by Homer et al., considerable attention has been given to
developing methods for releasing GWAS data in a privacy-preserving way. Here,
we develop an end-to-end differentially private method for solving regression
problems with convex penalty functions and selecting the penalty parameters by
cross-validation. In particular, we focus on penalized logistic regression with
elastic-net regularization, a method widely used to in GWAS analyses to
identify disease-causing genes. We show how a differentially private procedure
for penalized logistic regression with elastic-net regularization can be
applied to the analysis of GWAS data and evaluate our method's performance.
