Title: H91$Î±$ Radio Recombination Line and 3.5 cm Continuum Observations  of the Planetary Nebula NGC 3242
Abstract: We present high sensitivity H91$\alpha$ and 3.5 cm radio continuum
observations toward the planetary nebula NGC 3242. The electron temperature
determined assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium is consistent within
$\sim$10% with that derived from optical lines and the Balmer discontinuity.
The line emission and the continuum emission have very similar spatial
distribution, suggesting that at this wavelength there is no other continuum
process present in a significant manner. In particular, we conclude that
emission from spinning dust is not important at this wavelength. In this radio
recombination line the nebula presents a radial velocity structure consistent
with that obtained from observations of optical lines.
