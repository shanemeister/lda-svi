Title: Layered black-box, behavioral interconnection perspective and  applications to the problem of communication with fidelity criteria, Part I:  i.i.d. sources
Abstract: In this paper, the problem of communication over an essentially unknown
channel, which is known to be able to communicate a source to a destination to
within a certain distortion level, is con- sidered from a behavioral,
interconnection view-point. Rates of re- liable communication are derived and
source-channel separation for communication with fidelity criteria is proved.
The results are then generalized to the multi-user setting under certain
assump- tions. Other applications of this problem problem which follow from
this perspective are discussed.
