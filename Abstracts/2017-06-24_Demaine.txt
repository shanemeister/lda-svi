Title: Tree-Residue Vertex-Breaking: a new tool for proving hardness
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new problem called Tree-Residue Vertex-Breaking
(TRVB): given a multigraph $G$ some of whose vertices are marked "breakable,"
is it possible to convert $G$ into a tree via a sequence of "vertex-breaking"
operations (disconnecting the edges at a degree-$k$ breakable vertex by
replacing that vertex with $k$ degree-$1$ vertices)? We consider the special
cases of TRVB with any combination of the following additional constraints: $G$
must be planar, $G$ must be a simple graph, the degree of every breakable
vertex must belong to an allowed list $B$, and the degree of every unbreakable
vertex must belong to an allowed list $U$. We fully characterize these variants
of TRVB as polynomially solvable or NP-complete. The two results which we
expect to be most generally applicable are that (1) TRVB is polynomially
solvable when breakable vertices are restricted to have degree at most $3$; and
(2) for any $k \ge 4$, TRVB is NP-complete when the given multigraph is
restricted to be planar and to consist entirely of degree-$k$ breakable
vertices. To demonstrate the use of TRVB, we give a simple proof of the known
result that Hamiltonicity in max-degree-$3$ square grid graphs is NP-hard.
