Title: Anchored Discrete Factor Analysis
Abstract: We present a semi-supervised learning algorithm for learning discrete factor
analysis models with arbitrary structure on the latent variables. Our algorithm
assumes that every latent variable has an "anchor", an observed variable with
only that latent variable as its parent. Given such anchors, we show that it is
possible to consistently recover moments of the latent variables and use these
moments to learn complete models. We also introduce a new technique for
improving the robustness of method-of-moment algorithms by optimizing over the
marginal polytope or its relaxations. We evaluate our algorithm using two
real-world tasks, tag prediction on questions from the Stack Overflow website
and medical diagnosis in an emergency department.
