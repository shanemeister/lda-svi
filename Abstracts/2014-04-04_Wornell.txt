Title: Efficient Task Replication for Fast Response Times in Parallel  Computation
Abstract: One typical use case of large-scale distributed computing in data centers is
to decompose a computation job into many independent tasks and run them in
parallel on different machines, sometimes known as the "embarrassingly
parallel" computation. For this type of computation, one challenge is that the
time to execute a task for each machine is inherently variable, and the overall
response time is constrained by the execution time of the slowest machine. To
address this issue, system designers introduce task replication, which sends
the same task to multiple machines, and obtains result from the machine that
finishes first. While task replication reduces response time, it usually
increases resource usage. In this work, we propose a theoretical framework to
analyze the trade-off between response time and resource usage. We show that,
while in general, there is a tension between response time and resource usage,
there exist scenarios where replicating tasks judiciously reduces completion
time and resource usage simultaneously. Given the execution time distribution
for machines, we investigate the conditions for a scheduling policy to achieve
optimal performance trade-off, and propose efficient algorithms to search for
optimal or near-optimal scheduling policies. Our analysis gives insights on
when and why replication helps, which can be used to guide scheduler design in
large-scale distributed computing systems.
