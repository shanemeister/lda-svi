Title: Adaptive Importance Sampling for Estimation in Structured Domains
Abstract: Sampling is an important tool for estimating large, complex sums and
integrals over high dimensional spaces. For instance, important sampling has
been used as an alternative to exact methods for inference in belief networks.
Ideally, we want to have a sampling distribution that provides optimal-variance
estimators. In this paper, we present methods that improve the sampling
distribution by systematically adapting it as we obtain information from the
samples. We present a stochastic-gradient-descent method for sequentially
updating the sampling distribution based on the direct minization of the
variance. We also present other stochastic-gradient-descent methods based on
the minimizationof typical notions of distance between the current sampling
distribution and approximations of the target, optimal distribution. We finally
validate and compare the different methods empirically by applying them to the
problem of action evaluation in influence diagrams.
