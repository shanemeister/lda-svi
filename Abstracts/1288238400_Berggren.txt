Title: Superconducting microfabricated ion traps
Abstract: We fabricate superconducting ion traps with niobium and niobium nitride and
trap single 88Sr ions at cryogenic temperatures. The superconducting transition
is verified and characterized by measuring the resistance and critical current
using a 4-wire measurement on the trap structure, and observing change in the
rf reflection. The lowest observed heating rate is 2.1(3) quanta/sec at 800 kHz
at 6 K and shows no significant change across the superconducting transition,
suggesting that anomalous heating is primarily caused by noise sources on the
surface. This demonstration of superconducting ion traps opens up possibilities
for integrating trapped ions and molecular ions with superconducting devices.
