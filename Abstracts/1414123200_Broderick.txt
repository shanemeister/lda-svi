Title: Posteriors, conjugacy, and exponential families for completely random  measures
Abstract: We demonstrate how to calculate posteriors for general CRM-based priors and
likelihoods for Bayesian nonparametric models. We further show how to represent
Bayesian nonparametric priors as a sequence of finite draws using a
size-biasing approach---and how to represent full Bayesian nonparametric models
via finite marginals. Motivated by conjugate priors based on exponential family
representations of likelihoods, we introduce a notion of exponential families
for CRMs, which we call exponential CRMs. This construction allows us to
specify automatic Bayesian nonparametric conjugate priors for exponential CRM
likelihoods. We demonstrate that our exponential CRMs allow particularly
straightforward recipes for size-biased and marginal representations of
Bayesian nonparametric models. Along the way, we prove that the gamma process
is a conjugate prior for the Poisson likelihood process and the beta prime
process is a conjugate prior for a process we call the odds Bernoulli process.
We deliver a size-biased representation of the gamma process and a marginal
representation of the gamma process coupled with a Poisson likelihood process.
