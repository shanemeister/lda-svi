Title: Value and Policy Iteration in Optimal Control and Adaptive Dynamic  Programming
Abstract: In this paper, we consider discrete-time infinite horizon problems of optimal
control to a terminal set of states. These are the problems that are often
taken as the starting point for adaptive dynamic programming. Under very
general assumptions, we establish the uniqueness of solution of Bellman's
equation, and we provide convergence results for value and policy iteration.
