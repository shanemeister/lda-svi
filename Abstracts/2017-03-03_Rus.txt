Title: Baxter's Homunculus: Virtual Reality Spaces for Teleoperation in  Manufacturing
Abstract: Expensive specialized systems have hampered development of telerobotic
systems for manufacturing systems. In this paper we demonstrate a telerobotic
system which can reduce the cost of such system by leveraging commercial
virtual reality(VR) technology and integrating it with existing robotics
control software. The system runs on a commercial gaming engine using off the
shelf VR hardware. This system can be deployed on multiple network
architectures from a wired local network to a wireless network connection over
the Internet. The system is based on the homunculus model of mind wherein we
embed the user in a virtual reality control room. The control room allows for
multiple sensor display, dynamic mapping between the user and robot, does not
require the production of duals for the robot, or its environment. The control
room is mapped to a space inside the robot to provide a sense of co-location
within the robot. We compared our system with state of the art automation
algorithms for assembly tasks, showing a 100% success rate for our system
compared with a 66% success rate for automated systems. We demonstrate that our
system can be used for pick and place, assembly, and manufacturing tasks.
