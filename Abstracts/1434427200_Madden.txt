Title: Towards a unified query language for provenance and versioning
Abstract: Organizations and teams collect and acquire data from various sources, such
as social interactions, financial transactions, sensor data, and genome
sequencers. Different teams in an organization as well as different data
scientists within a team are interested in extracting a variety of insights
which require combining and collaboratively analyzing datasets in diverse ways.
DataHub is a system that aims to provide robust version control and provenance
management for such a scenario. To be truly useful for collaborative data
science, one also needs the ability to specify queries and analysis tasks over
the versioning and the provenance information in a unified manner. In this
paper, we present an initial design of our query language, called VQuel, that
aims to support such unified querying over both types of information, as well
as the intermediate and final results of analyses. We also discuss some of the
key language design and implementation challenges moving forward.
