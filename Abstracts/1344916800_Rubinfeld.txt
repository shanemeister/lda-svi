Title: Local reconstructors and tolerant testers for connectivity and diameter
Abstract: A local property reconstructor for a graph property is an algorithm which,
given oracle access to the adjacency list of a graph that is "close" to having
the property, provides oracle access to the adjacency matrix of a "correction"
of the graph, i.e. a graph which has the property and is close to the given
graph. For this model, we achieve local property reconstructors for the
properties of connectivity and $k$-connectivity in undirected graphs, and the
property of strong connectivity in directed graphs. Along the way, we present a
method of transforming a local reconstructor (which acts as a "adjacency matrix
oracle" for the corrected graph) into an "adjacency list oracle". This allows
us to recursively use our local reconstructor for $(k-1)$-connectivity to
obtain a local reconstructor for $k$-connectivity.
We also extend this notion of local property reconstruction to parametrized
graph properties (for instance, having diameter at most $D$ for some parameter
$D$) and require that the corrected graph has the property with parameter close
to the original. We obtain a local reconstructor for the low diameter property,
where if the original graph is close to having diameter $D$, then the corrected
graph has diameter roughly 2D.
We also exploit a connection between local property reconstruction and
property testing, observed by Brakerski, to obtain new tolerant property
testers for all of the aforementioned properties. Except for the one for
connectivity, these are the first tolerant property testers for these
properties.
