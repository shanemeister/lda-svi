Title: Affine Monotonic and Risk-Sensitive Models in Dynamic Programming
Abstract: In this paper we consider a broad class of infinite horizon discrete-time
optimal control models that involve a nonnegative cost function and an affine
mapping in their dynamic programming equation. They include as special cases
classical models such as stochastic undiscounted nonnegative cost problems,
stochastic multiplicative cost problems, and risk-sensitive problems with
exponential cost. We focus on the case where the state space is finite and the
control space has some compactness properties. We assume that the affine
mapping has a semicontractive character, whereby for some policies it is a
contraction, while for others it is not. In one line of analysis, we impose
assumptions that guarantee that the latter policies cannot be optimal. Under
these assumptions, we prove strong results that resemble those for discounted
Markovian decision problems, such as the uniqueness of solution of Bellman's
equation, and the validity of forms of value and policy iteration. In the
absence of these assumptions, the results are weaker and unusual in character:
the optimal cost function need not be a solution of Bellman's equation, and an
optimal policy may not be found by value or policy iteration. Instead the
optimal cost function over just the contractive policies solves Bellman's
equation, and can be computed by a variety of algorithms.
