Title: Planning for Decentralized Control of Multiple Robots Under Uncertainty
Abstract: We describe a probabilistic framework for synthesizing control policies for
general multi-robot systems, given environment and sensor models and a cost
function. Decentralized, partially observable Markov decision processes
(Dec-POMDPs) are a general model of decision processes where a team of agents
must cooperate to optimize some objective (specified by a shared reward or cost
function) in the presence of uncertainty, but where communication limitations
mean that the agents cannot share their state, so execution must proceed in a
decentralized fashion. While Dec-POMDPs are typically intractable to solve for
real-world problems, recent research on the use of macro-actions in Dec-POMDPs
has significantly increased the size of problem that can be practically solved
as a Dec-POMDP. We describe this general model, and show how, in contrast to
most existing methods that are specialized to a particular problem class, it
can synthesize control policies that use whatever opportunities for
coordination are present in the problem, while balancing off uncertainty in
outcomes, sensor information, and information about other agents. We use three
variations on a warehouse task to show that a single planner of this type can
generate cooperative behavior using task allocation, direct communication, and
signaling, as appropriate.
