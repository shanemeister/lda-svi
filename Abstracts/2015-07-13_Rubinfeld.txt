Title: Testing Shape Restrictions of Discrete Distributions
Abstract: We study the question of testing structured properties (classes) of discrete
distributions. Specifically, given sample access to an arbitrary distribution
$D$ over $[n]$ and a property $\mathcal{P}$, the goal is to distinguish between
$D\in\mathcal{P}$ and $\ell_1(D,\mathcal{P})>\varepsilon$. We develop a general
algorithm for this question, which applies to a large range of
"shape-constrained" properties, including monotone, log-concave, $t$-modal,
piecewise-polynomial, and Poisson Binomial distributions. Moreover, for all
cases considered, our algorithm has near-optimal sample complexity with regard
to the domain size and is computationally efficient. For most of these classes,
we provide the first non-trivial tester in the literature. In addition, we also
describe a generic method to prove lower bounds for this problem, and use it to
show our upper bounds are nearly tight. Finally, we extend some of our
techniques to tolerant testing, deriving nearly-tight upper and lower bounds
for the corresponding questions.
