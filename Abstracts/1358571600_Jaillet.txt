Title: Average-Case Performance of Rollout Algorithms for Knapsack Problems
Abstract: Rollout algorithms have demonstrated excellent performance on a variety of
dynamic and discrete optimization problems. Interpreted as an approximate
dynamic programming algorithm, a rollout algorithm estimates the value-to-go at
each decision stage by simulating future events while following a greedy
policy, referred to as the base policy. While in many cases rollout algorithms
are guaranteed to perform as well as their base policies, there have been few
theoretical results showing additional improvement in performance. In this
paper we perform a probabilistic analysis of the subset sum problem and
knapsack problem, giving theoretical evidence that rollout algorithms perform
strictly better than their base policies. Using a stochastic model from the
existing literature, we analyze two rollout methods that we refer to as the
consecutive rollout and exhaustive rollout, both of which employ a simple
greedy base policy. For the subset sum problem, we prove that after only a
single iteration of the rollout algorithm, both methods yield at least a 30%
reduction in the expected gap between the solution value and capacity, relative
to the base policy. Analogous results are shown for the knapsack problem.
