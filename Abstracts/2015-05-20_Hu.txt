Title: Ab initio prediction of the mechanical properties of alloys: The case of  Ni/Mn-doped ferromagnetic Fe
Abstract: First-principles alloy theory, formulated within the exact muffin-tin
orbitals method in combination with the coherent-potential approximation, is
used to study the mechanical properties of ferromagnetic body-centered cubic
(bcc) Fe$_{1-x}$M$_x$ alloys (M=Mn or Ni, $0\le x \le 0.1$). We consider
several physical parameters accessible from \emph{ab initio} calculations and
their combinations in various phenomenological models to compare the effect of
Mn and Ni on the properties of Fe. Alloying is found to slightly alter the
lattice parameters and produce noticeable influence on elastic moduli. Both Mn
and Ni decrease the surface energy and the unstable stacking fault energy
associated with the $\{110\}$ surface facet and the $\{110\}\langle111\rangle$
slip system, respectively. Nickel is found to produce larger effect on the
planar fault energies than Mn. The semi-empirical ductility criteria by Rice
and Pugh consistently predict that Ni enhances the ductility of Fe but give
contradictory results in the case of Mn doping. The origin of the discrepancy
between the two criteria is discussed and an alternative measure of the
ductile-brittle behavior based on the theoretical cleavage strength and
single-crystal shear modulus $G\{110\}\langle111\rangle$ is proposed.
