Title: Learning Deep Features for Discriminative Localization
Abstract: In this work, we revisit the global average pooling layer proposed in [13],
and shed light on how it explicitly enables the convolutional neural network to
have remarkable localization ability despite being trained on image-level
labels. While this technique was previously proposed as a means for
regularizing training, we find that it actually builds a generic localizable
deep representation that can be applied to a variety of tasks. Despite the
apparent simplicity of global average pooling, we are able to achieve 37.1%
top-5 error for object localization on ILSVRC 2014, which is remarkably close
to the 34.2% top-5 error achieved by a fully supervised CNN approach. We
demonstrate that our network is able to localize the discriminative image
regions on a variety of tasks despite not being trained for them
