Title: Sublinear Algorithms for Approximating String Compressibility
Abstract: We raise the question of approximating the compressibility of a string with
respect to a fixed compression scheme, in sublinear time. We study this
question in detail for two popular lossless compression schemes: run-length
encoding (RLE) and Lempel-Ziv (LZ), and present sublinear algorithms for
approximating compressibility with respect to both schemes. We also give
several lower bounds that show that our algorithms for both schemes cannot be
improved significantly.
Our investigation of LZ yields results whose interest goes beyond the initial
questions we set out to study. In particular, we prove combinatorial structural
lemmas that relate the compressibility of a string with respect to Lempel-Ziv
to the number of distinct short substrings contained in it. In addition, we
show that approximating the compressibility with respect to LZ is related to
approximating the support size of a distribution.
