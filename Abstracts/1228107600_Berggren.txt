Title: Electrothermal feedback in superconducting nanowire single-photon  detectors
Abstract: We investigate the role of electrothermal feedback in the operation of
superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs). It is found that the
desired mode of operation for SNSPDs is only achieved if this feedback is
unstable, which happens naturally through the slow electrical response
associated with their relatively large kinetic inductance. If this response is
sped up in an effort to increase the device count rate, the electrothermal
feedback becomes stable and results in an effect known as latching, where the
device is locked in a resistive state and can no longer detect photons. We
present a set of experiments which elucidate this effect, and a simple model
which quantitatively explains the results.
