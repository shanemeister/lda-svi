Title: SparsityBoost: A New Scoring Function for Learning Bayesian Network  Structure
Abstract: We give a new consistent scoring function for structure learning of Bayesian
networks. In contrast to traditional approaches to scorebased structure
learning, such as BDeu or MDL, the complexity penalty that we propose is
data-dependent and is given by the probability that a conditional independence
test correctly shows that an edge cannot exist. What really distinguishes this
new scoring function from earlier work is that it has the property of becoming
computationally easier to maximize as the amount of data increases. We prove a
polynomial sample complexity result, showing that maximizing this score is
guaranteed to correctly learn a structure with no false edges and a
distribution close to the generating distribution, whenever there exists a
Bayesian network which is a perfect map for the data generating distribution.
Although the new score can be used with any search algorithm, we give empirical
results showing that it is particularly effective when used together with a
linear programming relaxation approach to Bayesian network structure learning.
