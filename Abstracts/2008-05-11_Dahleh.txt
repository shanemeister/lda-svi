Title: A Linear Programming Relaxation and a Heuristic for the Restless Bandit  Problem with General Switching Costs
Abstract: We extend a relaxation technique due to Bertsimas and Nino-Mora for the
restless bandit problem to the case where arbitrary costs penalize switching
between the bandits. We also construct a one-step lookahead policy using the
solution of the relaxation. Computational experiments and a bound for
approximate dynamic programming provide some empirical support for the
heuristic.
