Title: Beta-Beta Bounds: Finite-Blocklength Analog of the Golden Formula
Abstract: It is well known that the mutual information between two random variables can
be expressed as the difference of two relative entropies that depend on an
auxiliary distribution, a relation sometimes referred to as the golden formula.
This paper is concerned with a finite-blocklength extension of this relation.
This extension consists of two elements: (i) a finite-blocklength
channel-coding converse bound by Polyanskiy and Verd\'u (2014), which involves
the ratio between two Neyman-Pearson $\beta$ functions (beta-beta converse
bound), and (ii) a novel beta-beta channel-coding achievability bound,
expressed again as the ratio between two Neyman-Pearson $\beta$ functions.
To demonstrate the usefulness of this finite-blocklength extension of the
golden formula, the beta-beta achievability and converse bounds are used to
obtain a finite-blocklength extension of Verd\'u's (2002) wideband-slope
approximation. The proof parallels the elegant derivation in Verd\'u (2002),
with the beta-beta bounds used in place of the golden formula.
The beta-beta (achievability) bound is also shown to be useful in cases where
the capacity-achieving output distribution is not a product distribution due
to, e.g., a cost constraint or structural constraints on the codebook, such as
orthogonality or constant composition. As an example, the bound is used to
characterize the channel dispersion of the additive exponential-noise channel
and to obtain a finite-blocklength achievability bound (the tightest to date)
for multiple-input multiple-output Rayleigh-fading channels with perfect
channel state information at the receiver.
