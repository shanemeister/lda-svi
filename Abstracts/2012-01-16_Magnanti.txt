Title: Separable Concave Optimization Approximately Equals Piecewise-Linear  Optimization
Abstract: We study the problem of minimizing a nonnegative separable concave function
over a compact feasible set. We approximate this problem to within a factor of
1+epsilon by a piecewise-linear minimization problem over the same feasible
set. Our main result is that when the feasible set is a polyhedron, the number
of resulting pieces is polynomial in the input size of the polyhedron and
linear in 1/epsilon. For many practical concave cost problems, the resulting
piecewise-linear cost problem can be formulated as a well-studied discrete
optimization problem. As a result, a variety of polynomial-time exact
algorithms, approximation algorithms, and polynomial-time heuristics for
discrete optimization problems immediately yield fully polynomial-time
approximation schemes, approximation algorithms, and polynomial-time heuristics
for the corresponding concave cost problems.
We illustrate our approach on two problems. For the concave cost
multicommodity flow problem, we devise a new heuristic and study its
performance using computational experiments. We are able to approximately solve
significantly larger test instances than previously possible, and obtain
solutions on average within 4.27% of optimality. For the concave cost facility
location problem, we obtain a new 1.4991+epsilon approximation algorithm.
