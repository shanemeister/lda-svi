Title: Fast Sampling for Strongly Rayleigh Measures with Application to  Determinantal Point Processes
Abstract: In this note we consider sampling from (non-homogeneous) strongly Rayleigh
probability measures. As an important corollary, we obtain a fast mixing Markov
Chain sampler for Determinantal Point Processes.
