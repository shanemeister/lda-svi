Title: Three Colors Suffice: Conflict-Free Coloring of Planar Graphs
Abstract: A conflict-free k-coloring of a graph assigns one of k different colors to
some of the vertices such that, for every vertex v, there is a color that is
assigned to exactly one vertex among v and v's neighbors. Such colorings have
applications in wireless networking, robotics, and geometry, and are
well-studied in graph theory. Here we study the natural problem of the
conflict-free chromatic number chi_CF (G) (the smallest k for which
conflict-free k-colorings exist), with a focus on planar graphs. For general
graphs, we prove the conflict-free variant of the famous Hadwiger Conjecture:
If G does not contain K_{k+1} as a minor, then chi_CF (G) \leq k. For planar
graphs, we obtain a tight worst-case bound: three colors are sometimes
necessary and always sufficient. In addition, we give a complete
characterization of the algorithmic/computational complexity of conflict-free
coloring. It is NP-complete to decide whether a planar graph has a
conflict-free coloring with one color, while for outerplanar graphs, this can
be decided in polynomial time. Furthermore, it is NP-complete to decide whether
a planar graph has a conflict-free coloring with two colors, while for
outerplanar graphs, two colors always suffice. For the bicriteria problem of
minimizing the number of colored vertices subject to a given bound k on the
number of colors, we give a full algorithmic characterization in terms of
complexity and approximation for outerplanar and planar graphs.
