Title: Observing---and Imaging---Active Galactic Nuclei with the Event Horizon  Telescope
Abstract: Originally developed to image the shadow region of the central black hole in
Sagittarius A* and in the nearby galaxy M87, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)
provides deep, very high angular resolution data on other AGN sources too. The
challenges of working with EHT data have spurred the development of new image
reconstruction algorithms. This work briefly reviews the status of the EHT and
its utility for observing AGN sources, with emphasis on novel imaging
techniques that offer the promise of better reconstructions at 1.3 mm and other
wavelengths.
