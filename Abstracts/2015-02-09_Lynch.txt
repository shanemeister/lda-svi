Title: Consensus using Asynchronous Failure Detectors
Abstract: The FLP result shows that crash-tolerant consensus is impossible to solve in
asynchronous systems, and several solutions have been proposed for
crash-tolerant consensus under alternative (stronger) models. One popular
approach is to augment the asynchronous system with appropriate failure
detectors, which provide (potentially unreliable) information about process
crashes in the system, to circumvent the FLP impossibility.
In this paper, we demonstrate the exact mechanism by which (sufficiently
powerful) asynchronous failure detectors enable solving crash-tolerant
consensus. Our approach, which borrows arguments from the FLP impossibility
proof and the famous result from CHT, which shows that $\Omega$ is a weakest
failure detector to solve consensus, also yields a natural proof to $\Omega$ as
a weakest asynchronous failure detector to solve consensus. The use of I/O
automata theory in our approach enables us to model execution in a more
detailed fashion than CHT and also addresses the latent assumptions and
assertions in the original result in CHT.
