Title: Fixed-point quantum search with an optimal number of queries
Abstract: Grover's quantum search and its generalization, quantum amplitude
amplification, provide quadratic advantage over classical algorithms for a
diverse set of tasks, but are tricky to use without knowing beforehand what
fraction $\lambda$ of the initial state is comprised of the target states. In
contrast, fixed-point search algorithms need only a reliable lower bound on
this fraction, but, as a consequence, lose the very quadratic advantage that
makes Grover's algorithm so appealing. Here we provide the first version of
amplitude amplification that achieves fixed-point behavior without sacrificing
the quantum speedup. Our result incorporates an adjustable bound on the failure
probability, and, for a given number of oracle queries, guarantees that this
bound is satisfied over the broadest possible range of $\lambda$.
