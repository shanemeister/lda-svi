Title: STRIPS Planning in Infinite Domains
Abstract: Many robotic planning applications involve continuous actions with highly
non-linear constraints, which cannot be modeled using modern planners that
construct a propositional representation. We introduce STRIPStream: an
extension of the STRIPS language which can model these domains by supporting
the specification of blackbox generators to handle complex constraints. The
outputs of these generators interact with actions through possibly infinite
streams of objects and static predicates. We provide two algorithms which both
reduce STRIPStream problems to a sequence of finite-domain planning problems.
The representation and algorithms are entirely domain independent. We
demonstrate our framework on simple illustrative domains, and then on a
high-dimensional, continuous robotic task and motion planning domain.
