Title: Rapid Co-optimization of Processing and Circuit Design to Overcome  Carbon Nanotube Variations
Abstract: Carbon nanotube field-effect transistors (CNFETs) are promising candidates
for building energy-efficient digital systems at highly-scaled technology
nodes. However, carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are inherently subject to variations
that reduce circuit yield, increase susceptibility to noise, and severely
degrade their anticipated energy and speed benefits. Joint exploration and
optimization of CNT processing options and CNFET circuit design are required to
overcome this outstanding challenge. Unfortunately, existing approaches for
such exploration and optimization are computationally expensive, and mostly
rely on trial-and-error-based ad hoc techniques. In this paper, we present a
framework that quickly evaluates the impact of CNT variations on circuit delay
and noise margin, and systematically explores the large space of CNT processing
options to derive optimized CNT processing and CNFET circuit design guidelines.
We demonstrate that our framework: 1) runs over 100x faster than existing
approaches, and 2) accurately identifies the most important CNT processing
parameters, together with CNFET circuit design parameters (e.g., for CNFET
sizing and standard cell layouts), to minimize the impact of CNT variations on
CNFET circuit speed with less than 5% energy cost, while simultaneously meeting
circuit-level noise margin and yield constraints.
