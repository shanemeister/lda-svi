Title: Using Straggler Replication to Reduce Latency in Large-scale Parallel  Computing (Extended Version)
Abstract: Users expect fast and fluid response from today's cloud infrastructure.
Large-scale computing frameworks such as MapReduce divide jobs into many
parallel tasks and execute them on different machines to enable faster
processing. But the tasks on the slowest machines (straggling tasks) become the
bottleneck in the completion of the job. One way to combat the variability in
machine response time, is to add replicas of straggling tasks and wait for one
copy to finish.
In this paper we analyze how task replication strategies can be used to
reduce latency, and their impact on the cost of computing resources. We use
extreme value theory to show that the tail of the execution time distribution
is the key factor in characterizing the trade-off between latency and computing
cost. From this trade-off we can determine which task replication strategies
reduce latency, without a large increase in computing cost. We also propose a
heuristic algorithm to search for the best replication strategies when it is
difficult to fit a simple distribution to model the empirical behavior of task
execution time, and use the proposed analysis techniques. Evaluation of the
heuristic policies on Google Trace data shows a significant latency reduction
compared to the replication strategy used in MapReduce.
