Title: Gauss quadrature for matrix inverse forms with applications
Abstract: We present a framework for accelerating a spectrum of machine learning
algorithms that require computation of bilinear inverse forms $u^\top A^{-1}u$,
where $A$ is a positive definite matrix and $u$ a given vector. Our framework
is built on Gauss-type quadrature and easily scales to large, sparse matrices.
Further, it allows retrospective computation of lower and upper bounds on
$u^\top A^{-1}u$, which in turn accelerates several algorithms. We prove that
these bounds tighten iteratively and converge at a linear (geometric) rate. To
our knowledge, ours is the first work to demonstrate these key properties of
Gauss-type quadrature, which is a classical and deeply studied topic. We
illustrate empirical consequences of our results by using quadrature to
accelerate machine learning tasks involving determinantal point processes and
submodular optimization, and observe tremendous speedups in several instances.
