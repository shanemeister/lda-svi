Title: Existence of Stable Exclusive Bilateral Exchanges in Networks
Abstract: In this paper we show that when individuals in a bipartite network
exclusively choose partners and exchange valued goods with their partners, then
there exists a set of exchanges that are pair-wise stable. Pair-wise stability
implies that no individual breaks her partnership and no two neighbors in the
network can form a new partnership while breaking other partnerships if any so
that at least one of them improves her payoff and the other one does at least
as good. We consider a general class of continuous, strictly convex and
strongly monotone preferences over bundles of goods for individuals. Thus, this
work extends the general equilibrium framework from markets to networks with
exclusive exchanges. We present the complete existence proof using the
existence of a generalized stable matching in
\cite{Generalized-Stable-Matching}. The existence proof can be extended to
problems in social games as in \cite{Matching-Equilibrium} and
\cite{Social-Games}.
