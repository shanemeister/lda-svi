Title: Exchangeable Trait Allocations
Abstract: Clustering requires placing data into mutually exclusive groups, while
feature allocations allow each datum to exhibit binary membership in multiple
groups. But often, data points can not only belong to multiple groups but have
different levels of belonging in each group. We refer to the corresponding
relaxation of these combinatorial structures as a "trait allocation." The
exchangeable partition probability function (EPPF) allows for practical
inference in clustering models, and the Kingman paintbox provides a
representation for clustering that allows us to study all exchangeable
clustering models at once. We provide the analogous exchangeable trait
probability function (ETPF) and paintbox representation for trait allocations,
along with a characterization of all trait allocations with an ETPF. Our proofs
avoid the unnecessary auxiliary randomness of previous specialized
constructions and---unlike previous feature allocation
characterizations---fully capture single-occurrence "dust" groups. We further
introduce a novel constrained version of the ETPF that we use to establish the
first direct connection between the probability functions for clustering,
feature allocations, and trait allocations. As an application of our general
theory, we characterize the distribution of all edge-exchangeable graphs, a
recently-developed model that captures realistic sparse graph sequences.
