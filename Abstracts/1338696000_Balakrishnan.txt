Title: De-randomizing Shannon: The Design and Analysis of a Capacity-Achieving  Rateless Code
Abstract: This paper presents an analysis of spinal codes, a class of rateless codes
proposed recently. We prove that spinal codes achieve Shannon capacity for the
binary symmetric channel (BSC) and the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)
channel with an efficient polynomial-time encoder and decoder. They are the
first rateless codes with proofs of these properties for BSC and AWGN. The key
idea in the spinal code is the sequential application of a hash function over
the message bits. The sequential structure of the code turns out to be crucial
for efficient decoding. Moreover, counter to the wisdom of having an expander
structure in good codes, we show that the spinal code, despite its sequential
structure, achieves capacity. The pseudo-randomness provided by a hash function
suffices for this purpose. Our proof introduces a variant of Gallager's result
characterizing the error exponent of random codes for any memoryless channel.
We present a novel application of these error-exponent results within the
framework of an efficient sequential code. The application of a hash function
over the message bits provides a methodical and effective way to de-randomize
Shannon's random codebook construction.
