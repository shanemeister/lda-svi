Title: Error-and-Erasure Decoding for Block Codes with Feedback
Abstract: Inner and outer bounds are derived on the optimal performance of fixed length
block codes on discrete memoryless channels with feedback and
errors-and-erasures decoding. First an inner bound is derived using a two phase
encoding scheme with communication and control phases together with the optimal
decoding rule for the given encoding scheme, among decoding rules that can be
represented in terms of pairwise comparisons between the messages. Then an
outer bound is derived using a generalization of the straight-line bound to
errors-and-erasures decoders and the optimal error exponent trade off of a
feedback encoder with two messages. In addition upper and lower bounds are
derived, for the optimal erasure exponent of error free block codes in terms of
the rate. Finally we present a proof of the fact that the optimal trade off
between error exponents of a two message code does not increase with feedback
on DMCs.
