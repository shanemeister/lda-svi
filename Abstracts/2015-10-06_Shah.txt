Title: A Latent Source Model for Patch-Based Image Segmentation
Abstract: Despite the popularity and empirical success of patch-based nearest-neighbor
and weighted majority voting approaches to medical image segmentation, there
has been no theoretical development on when, why, and how well these
nonparametric methods work. We bridge this gap by providing a theoretical
performance guarantee for nearest-neighbor and weighted majority voting
segmentation under a new probabilistic model for patch-based image
segmentation. Our analysis relies on a new local property for how similar
nearby patches are, and fuses existing lines of work on modeling natural
imagery patches and theory for nonparametric classification. We use the model
to derive a new patch-based segmentation algorithm that iterates between
inferring local label patches and merging these local segmentations to produce
a globally consistent image segmentation. Many existing patch-based algorithms
arise as special cases of the new algorithm.
