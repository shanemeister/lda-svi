Title: Bayesian Nonparametric Inference of Switching Linear Dynamical Systems
Abstract: Many complex dynamical phenomena can be effectively modeled by a system that
switches among a set of conditionally linear dynamical modes. We consider two
such models: the switching linear dynamical system (SLDS) and the switching
vector autoregressive (VAR) process. Our Bayesian nonparametric approach
utilizes a hierarchical Dirichlet process prior to learn an unknown number of
persistent, smooth dynamical modes. We additionally employ automatic relevance
determination to infer a sparse set of dynamic dependencies allowing us to
learn SLDS with varying state dimension or switching VAR processes with varying
autoregressive order. We develop a sampling algorithm that combines a truncated
approximation to the Dirichlet process with efficient joint sampling of the
mode and state sequences. The utility and flexibility of our model are
demonstrated on synthetic data, sequences of dancing honey bees, the IBOVESPA
stock index, and a maneuvering target tracking application.
