Title: Learning Gaussian Tree Models: Analysis of Error Exponents and Extremal  Structures
Abstract: The problem of learning tree-structured Gaussian graphical models from
independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) samples is considered. The
influence of the tree structure and the parameters of the Gaussian distribution
on the learning rate as the number of samples increases is discussed.
Specifically, the error exponent corresponding to the event that the estimated
tree structure differs from the actual unknown tree structure of the
distribution is analyzed. Finding the error exponent reduces to a least-squares
problem in the very noisy learning regime. In this regime, it is shown that the
extremal tree structure that minimizes the error exponent is the star for any
fixed set of correlation coefficients on the edges of the tree. If the
magnitudes of all the correlation coefficients are less than 0.63, it is also
shown that the tree structure that maximizes the error exponent is the Markov
chain. In other words, the star and the chain graphs represent the hardest and
the easiest structures to learn in the class of tree-structured Gaussian
graphical models. This result can also be intuitively explained by correlation
decay: pairs of nodes which are far apart, in terms of graph distance, are
unlikely to be mistaken as edges by the maximum-likelihood estimator in the
asymptotic regime.
