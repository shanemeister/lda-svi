Title: Structure learning of antiferromagnetic Ising models
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the computational complexity of learning the
graph structure underlying a discrete undirected graphical model from i.i.d.
samples. We first observe that the notoriously difficult problem of learning
parities with noise can be captured as a special case of learning graphical
models. This leads to an unconditional computational lower bound of $\Omega
(p^{d/2})$ for learning general graphical models on $p$ nodes of maximum degree
$d$, for the class of so-called statistical algorithms recently introduced by
Feldman et al (2013). The lower bound suggests that the $O(p^d)$ runtime
required to exhaustively search over neighborhoods cannot be significantly
improved without restricting the class of models.
Aside from structural assumptions on the graph such as it being a tree,
hypertree, tree-like, etc., many recent papers on structure learning assume
that the model has the correlation decay property. Indeed, focusing on
ferromagnetic Ising models, Bento and Montanari (2009) showed that all known
low-complexity algorithms fail to learn simple graphs when the interaction
strength exceeds a number related to the correlation decay threshold. Our
second set of results gives a class of repelling (antiferromagnetic) models
that have the opposite behavior: very strong interaction allows efficient
learning in time $O(p^2)$. We provide an algorithm whose performance
interpolates between $O(p^2)$ and $O(p^{d+2})$ depending on the strength of the
repulsion.
