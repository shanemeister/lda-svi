Title: Centralized and Distributed Newton Methods for Network Optimization and  Extensions
Abstract: We consider Newton methods for common types of single commodity and
multi-commodity network flow problems. Despite the potentially very large
dimension of the problem, they can be implemented using the conjugate gradient
method and low-dimensional network operations, as shown nearly thirty years
ago. We revisit these methods, compare them to more recent proposals, and
describe how they can be implemented in a distributed computing system. We also
discuss generalizations, including the treatment of arc gains, linear side
constraints, and related special structures.
