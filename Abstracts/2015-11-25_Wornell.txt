Title: On Throughput-Smoothness Trade-offs in Streaming Communication
Abstract: Unlike traditional file transfer where only total delay matters, streaming
applications impose delay constraints on each packet and require them to be in
order. To achieve fast in-order packet decoding, we have to compromise on the
throughput. We study this trade-off between throughput and smoothness in packet
decoding. We first consider a point-to-point streaming and analyze how the
trade-off is affected by the frequency of block-wise feedback, whereby the
source receives full channel state feedback at periodic intervals. We show that
frequent feedback can drastically improve the throughput-smoothness trade-off.
Then we consider the problem of multicasting a packet stream to two users. For
both point-to-point and multicast streaming, we propose a spectrum of coding
schemes that span different throughput-smoothness tradeoffs. One can choose an
appropriate coding scheme from these, depending upon the delay-sensitivity and
bandwidth limitations of the application. This work introduces a novel style of
analysis using renewal processes and Markov chains to analyze coding schemes.
