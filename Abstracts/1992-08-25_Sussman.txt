Title: The Last Three Minutes: Issues in Gravitational Wave Measurements of  Coalescing Compact Binaries
Abstract: Gravitational-wave interferometers are expected to monitor the last three
minutes of inspiral and final coalescence of neutron star and black hole
binaries at distances approaching cosmological, where the event rate may be
many per year. Because the binary's accumulated orbital phase can be measured
to a fractional accuracy $\ll 10^{-3}$ and relativistic effects are large, the
waveforms will be far more complex, carry more information, and be far harder
to model theoretically than has been expected. Theorists must begin now to lay
a foundation for extracting the waves' information.
