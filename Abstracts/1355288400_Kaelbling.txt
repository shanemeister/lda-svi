Title: The Thing That We Tried Didn't Work Very Well : Deictic Representation  in Reinforcement Learning
Abstract: Most reinforcement learning methods operate on propositional representations
of the world state. Such representations are often intractably large and
generalize poorly. Using a deictic representation is believed to be a viable
alternative: they promise generalization while allowing the use of existing
reinforcement-learning methods. Yet, there are few experiments on learning with
deictic representations reported in the literature. In this paper we explore
the effectiveness of two forms of deictic representation and a na\"{i}ve
propositional representation in a simple blocks-world domain. We find,
empirically, that the deictic representations actually worsen learning
performance. We conclude with a discussion of possible causes of these results
and strategies for more effective learning in domains with objects.
