Title: High Dimensional Inference with Random Maximum A-Posteriori  Perturbations
Abstract: This paper presents a new approach, called perturb-max, for high-dimensional
statistical inference that is based on applying random perturbations followed
by optimization. This framework injects randomness to maximum a-posteriori
(MAP) predictors by randomly perturbing the potential function for the input. A
classic result from extreme value statistics asserts that perturb-max
operations generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution using
high-dimensional perturbations. Unfortunately, the computational cost of
generating so many high-dimensional random variables can be prohibitive.
However, when the perturbations are of low dimension, sampling the perturb-max
prediction is as efficient as MAP optimization. This paper shows that the
expected value of perturb-max inference with low dimensional perturbations can
be used sequentially to generate unbiased samples from the Gibbs distribution.
Furthermore the expected value of the maximal perturbations is a natural bound
on the entropy of such perturb-max models. A measure concentration result for
perturb-max values shows that the deviation of their sampled average from its
expectation decays exponentially in the number of samples, allowing effective
approximation of the expectation.
