Title: Bounds for codes on pentagon and other cycles
Abstract: The capacity of a graph is defined as the rate of exponential grow of
independent sets in the strong powers of the graph. In strong power, an edge
connects two sequences if at each position letters are equal or adjacent. We
consider a variation of the problem where edges in the power graphs are removed
among sequences which differ in more than a fraction $\delta$ of coordinates.
For odd cycles, we derive an upper bound on the corresponding rate which
combines Lov\'asz' bound on the capacity with Delsarte's linear programming
bounds on the minimum distance of codes in Hamming spaces. For the pentagon,
this shows that for $\delta \ge {1-{1\over\sqrt{5}}}$ the Lov\'asz rate is the
best possible, while we prove by a Gilbert-Varshamov-type bound that a higher
rate is achievable for $\delta < {2\over 5}$.
Communication interpretation of this question is the problem of sending
quinary symbols subject to $\pm 1\mod 5$ disturbance. The maximal communication
rate subject to the zero undetected-error equals capacity of a pentagon. The
question addressed here is how much this rate can be increased if only a
fraction $\delta$ of symbols is allowed to be disturbed
