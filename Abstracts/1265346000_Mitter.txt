Title: Architecture for communication with a fidelity criterion in unknown  networks
Abstract: We prove that in order to communicate independent sources (this is the
unicast problem) between various users over an unknown medium to within various
distortion levels, it is sufficient to consider source-channel separation based
architectures: architectures which first compress the sources to within the
corresponding distortion levels followed by reliable communication over the
unknown medium. We are reducing the problem of universal rate-distortion
communication of independent sources over a network to the universal reliable
communication problem over networks. This is a reductionist view. We are not
solving the reliable communication problem in networks.
