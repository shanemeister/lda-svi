Title: Road Pricing for Spreading Peak Travel: Modeling and Design
Abstract: A case study of the Singapore road network provides empirical evidence that
road pricing can significantly affect commuter trip timing behaviors. In this
paper, we propose a model of trip timing decisions that reasonably matches the
observed commuters' behaviors. Our model explicitly captures the difference in
individuals' sensitivity to price, travel time and early or late arrival at
destination. New pricing schemes are suggested to better spread peak travel and
reduce traffic congestion. Simulation results based on the proposed model are
provided in comparison with the real data for the Singapore case study.
