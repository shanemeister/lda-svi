Title: Inherent Limitations of Hybrid Transactional Memory
Abstract: Several Hybrid Transactional Memory (HyTM) schemes have recently been
proposed to complement the fast, but best-effort, nature of Hardware
Transactional Memory (HTM) with a slow, reliable software backup. However, the
fundamental limitations of building a HyTM with nontrivial concurrency between
hardware and software transactions are still not well understood.
In this paper, we propose a general model for HyTM implementations, which
captures the ability of hardware transactions to buffer memory accesses, and
allows us to formally quantify and analyze the amount of overhead
(instrumentation) of a HyTM scheme. We prove the following: (1) it is
impossible to build a strictly serializable HyTM implementation that has both
uninstrumented reads and writes, even for weak progress guarantees, and (2)
under reasonable assumptions, in any opaque progressive HyTM, a hardware
transaction must incur instrumentation costs linear in the size of its data
set. We further provide two upper bound implementations whose instrumentation
costs are optimal with respect to their progress guarantees. In sum, this paper
captures for the first time an inherent trade-off between the degree of
concurrency a HyTM provides between hardware and software transactions, and the
amount of instrumentation overhead the implementation must incur.
