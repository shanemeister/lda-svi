Title: Optimal Tourist Problem and Anytime Planning of Trip Itineraries
Abstract: We introduce and study the problem in which a mobile sensing robot (our
tourist) is tasked to travel among and gather intelligence at a set of
spatially distributed point-of-interests (POIs). The quality of the information
collected at each POI is characterized by some non-decreasing reward function
over the time spent at the POI. With limited time budget, the robot must
balance between spending time traveling to POIs and spending time at POIs for
information collection (sensing) so as to maximize the total reward.
Alternatively, the robot may be required to acquire a minimum mount of reward
and hopes to do so with the least amount of time. We propose a mixed integer
programming (MIP) based anytime algorithm for solving these two NP-hard
optimization problems to arbitrary precision. The effectiveness of our
algorithm is demonstrated using an extensive set of computational experiments
including the planning of a realistic itinerary for a first-time tourist in
Istanbul.
