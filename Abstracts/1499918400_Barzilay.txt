Title: Representation Learning for Grounded Spatial Reasoning
Abstract: The interpretation of spatial references is highly contextual, requiring
joint inference over both language and the environment. We consider the task of
spatial reasoning in a simulated environment, where an agent can act and
receive rewards. The proposed model learns a representation of the world
steered by instruction text. This design allows for precise alignment of local
neighborhoods with corresponding verbalizations, while also handling global
references in the instructions. We train our model with reinforcement learning
using a variant of generalized value iteration. The model outperforms
state-of-the-art approaches on several metrics, yielding a 45% reduction in
goal localization error.
