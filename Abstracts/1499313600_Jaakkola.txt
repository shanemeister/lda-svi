Title: A causal framework for explaining the predictions of black-box  sequence-to-sequence models
Abstract: We interpret the predictions of any black-box structured input-structured
output model around a specific input-output pair. Our method returns an
"explanation"' consisting of groups of input-output tokens that are causally
related. Our method infers these dependencies by querying the model with
perturbed inputs, generating a graph over tokens from the responses, and
solving a partitioning problem to select the most relevant components. We focus
the general approach on sequence-to-sequence problems, adopting a variational
autoencoder to yield meaningful input perturbations. We test our method across
several NLP sequence generation tasks.
