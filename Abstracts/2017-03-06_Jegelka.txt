Title: Max-value Entropy Search for Efficient Bayesian Optimization
Abstract: Entropy Search (ES) and Predictive Entropy Search (PES) are popular and
empirically successful Bayesian Optimization techniques. Both rely on a
compelling information-theoretic motivation, and maximize the information
gained about the $\arg\max$ of the unknown function. Yet, both are plagued by
expensive computation, e.g., for estimating entropy. We propose a new
criterion, Max-value Entropy Search (MES), that instead uses the information
about the maximum value. We observe that MES maintains or improves the good
empirical performance of ES/PES, while tremendously lightening the
computational burden. In particular, MES is much more robust to the number of
samples used for computing entropy, and hence more efficient. We show relations
of MES to other BO methods, and establish a regret bound. Empirical evaluations
on a variety of tasks demonstrate the good performance of MES.
