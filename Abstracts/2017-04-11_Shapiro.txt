Title: Universal Quantum Computation using Coherent $Ï‡^{(2)}$ Interactions
Abstract: We show that universal quantum computation, in certain qubit and qutrit
bases, can be realized using only linear optics and coherent $\chi^{(2)}$
(three-wave-mixing) interactions. Qutrit basis universality is proven from
group theory: $\chi^{(2)}$ Hamiltonians and photon-number operators generate
the full $\mathfrak{u}(3)$ Lie algebra in the two-photon-pump qutrit subspace,
which, together with our construction of the qutrit controlled-phase gate, is
universal. We also construct a universal dual-rail qubit-basis gate set using
coherent $\chi^{(2)}$ interactions and linear optics that is amenable to
near-term experimental implementation.
