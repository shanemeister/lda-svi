Title: The MOSDEF Survey: Detection of [OIII]$Î»$4363 and the  direct-method oxygen abundance of a star-forming galaxy at z=3.08
Abstract: We present measurements of the electron-temperature based oxygen abundance
for a highly star-forming galaxy at z=3.08, COSMOS-1908. This is the highest
redshift at which [OIII]$\lambda$4363 has been detected, and the first time
that this line has been measured at z>2. We estimate an oxygen abundance of
12+log(O/H)$=8.00^{+0.13}_{-0.14}$. This galaxy is a low-mass ($10^{9.3}$
M$_{\odot}$), highly star-forming ($\sim50$ M$_{\odot}$ yr$^{-1}$) system that
hosts a young stellar population ($\sim160$ Myr). We investigate the physical
conditions of the ionized gas in COSMOS-1908 and find that this galaxy has a
high ionization parameter, little nebular reddening ($E(B-V)_{\rm gas}<0.14$),
and a high electron density ($n_e\sim500$ cm$^{-3}$). We compare the ratios of
strong oxygen, neon, and hydrogen lines to the direct-method oxygen abundance
for COSMOS-1908 and additional star-forming galaxies at z=0-1.8 with
[OIII]$\lambda$4363 measurements, and show that galaxies at z$\sim$1-3 follow
the same strong-line correlations as galaxies in the local universe. This
agreement suggests that the relationship between ionization parameter and O/H
is similar for z$\sim$0 and high-redshift galaxies. These results imply that
metallicity calibrations based on lines of oxygen, neon, and hydrogen do not
strongly evolve with redshift and can reliably estimate abundances out to
z$\sim$3, paving the way for robust measurements of the evolution of the
mass-metallicity relation to high redshift.
