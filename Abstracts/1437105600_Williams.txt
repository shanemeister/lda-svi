Title: Probabilistic Polynomials and Hamming Nearest Neighbors
Abstract: We show how to compute any symmetric Boolean function on $n$ variables over
any field (as well as the integers) with a probabilistic polynomial of degree
$O(\sqrt{n \log(1/\epsilon)})$ and error at most $\epsilon$. The degree
dependence on $n$ and $\epsilon$ is optimal, matching a lower bound of Razborov
(1987) and Smolensky (1987) for the MAJORITY function. The proof is
constructive: a low-degree polynomial can be efficiently sampled from the
distribution.
This polynomial construction is combined with other algebraic ideas to give
the first subquadratic time algorithm for computing a (worst-case) batch of
Hamming distances in superlogarithmic dimensions, exactly. To illustrate, let
$c(n) : \mathbb{N} \rightarrow \mathbb{N}$. Suppose we are given a database $D$
of $n$ vectors in $\{0,1\}^{c(n) \log n}$ and a collection of $n$ query vectors
$Q$ in the same dimension. For all $u \in Q$, we wish to compute a $v \in D$
with minimum Hamming distance from $u$. We solve this problem in $n^{2-1/O(c(n)
\log^2 c(n))}$ randomized time. Hence, the problem is in "truly subquadratic"
time for $O(\log n)$ dimensions, and in subquadratic time for $d = o((\log^2
n)/(\log \log n)^2)$. We apply the algorithm to computing pairs with maximum
inner product, closest pair in $\ell_1$ for vectors with bounded integer
entries, and pairs with maximum Jaccard coefficients.
