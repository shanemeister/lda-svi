Title: Mach-Zehnder Interferometry in a Strongly Driven Superconducting Qubit
Abstract: We demonstrate Mach-Zehnder-type interferometry in a superconducting flux
qubit. The qubit is a tunable artificial atom, whose ground and excited states
exhibit an avoided crossing. Strongly driving the qubit with harmonic
excitation sweeps it through the avoided crossing two times per period. As the
induced Landau-Zener transitions act as coherent beamsplitters, the accumulated
phase between transitions, which varies with microwave amplitude, results in
quantum interference fringes for n=1...20 photon transitions. The
generalization of optical Mach-Zehnder interferometry, performed in qubit phase
space, provides an alternative means to manipulate and characterize the qubit
in the strongly-driven regime.
