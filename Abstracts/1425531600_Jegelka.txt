Title: Convex Optimization for Parallel Energy Minimization
Abstract: Energy minimization has been an intensely studied core problem in computer
vision. With growing image sizes (2D and 3D), it is now highly desirable to run
energy minimization algorithms in parallel. But many existing algorithms, in
particular, some efficient combinatorial algorithms, are difficult to
par-allelize. By exploiting results from convex and submodular theory, we
reformulate the quadratic energy minimization problem as a total variation
denoising problem, which, when viewed geometrically, enables the use of
projection and reflection based convex methods. The resulting min-cut algorithm
(and code) is conceptually very simple, and solves a sequence of TV denoising
problems. We perform an extensive empirical evaluation comparing
state-of-the-art combinatorial algorithms and convex optimization techniques.
On small problems the iterative convex methods match the combinatorial max-flow
algorithms, while on larger problems they offer other flexibility and important
gains: (a) their memory footprint is small; (b) their straightforward
parallelizability fits multi-core platforms; (c) they can easily be
warm-started; and (d) they quickly reach approximately good solutions, thereby
enabling faster "inexact" solutions. A key consequence of our approach based on
submodularity and convexity is that it is allows to combine any arbitrary
combinatorial or convex methods as subroutines, which allows one to obtain
hybrid combinatorial and convex optimization algorithms that benefit from the
strengths of both.
