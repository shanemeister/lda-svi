Title: Semidefinite Programming Approach to Gaussian Sequential Rate-Distortion  Trade-offs
Abstract: Sequential rate-distortion (SRD) theory provides a framework for studying the
fundamental trade-off between data-rate and data-quality in real-time
communication systems. In this paper, we consider the SRD problem for
multi-dimensional time-varying Gauss-Markov processes under mean-square
distortion criteria. We first revisit the sensor-estimator separation
principle, which asserts that considered SRD problem is equivalent to a joint
sensor and estimator design problem in which data-rate of the sensor output is
minimized while the estimator's performance satisfies the distortion criteria.
We then show that the optimal joint design can be performed by semidefinite
programming. A semidefinite representation of the corresponding SRD function is
obtained. Implications of the obtained result in the context of zero-delay
source coding theory and applications to networked control theory are also
discussed.
