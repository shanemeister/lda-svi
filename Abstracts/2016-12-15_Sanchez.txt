Title: Atomic-scale visualization of quasiparticle interference on a type-II  Weyl semimetal surface
Abstract: We combine quasiparticle interference simulation (theory) and atomic
resolution scanning tunneling spectro-microscopy (experiment) to visualize the
interference patterns on a type-II Weyl semimetal Mo$_{x}$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ for
the first time. Our simulation based on first-principles band topology
theoretically reveals the surface electron scattering behavior. We identify the
topological Fermi arc states and reveal the scattering properties of the
surface states in Mo$_{0.66}$W$_{0.34}$Te$_2$. In addition, our result reveals
an experimental signature of the topology via the interconnectivity of bulk and
surface states, which is essential for understanding the unusual nature of this
material.
