Title: Asynchronous Communication: Capacity Bounds and Suboptimality of  Training
Abstract: Several aspects of the problem of asynchronous point-to-point communication
without feedback are developed when the source is highly intermittent. In the
system model of interest, the codeword is transmitted at a random time within a
prescribed window whose length corresponds to the level of asynchronism between
the transmitter and the receiver. The decoder operates sequentially and
communication rate is defined as the ratio between the message size and the
elapsed time between when transmission commences and when the decoder makes a
decision.
For such systems, general upper and lower bounds on capacity as a function of
the level of asynchronism are established, and are shown to coincide in some
nontrivial cases. From these bounds, several properties of this asynchronous
capacity are derived. In addition, the performance of training-based schemes is
investigated. It is shown that such schemes, which implement synchronization
and information transmission on separate degrees of freedom in the encoding,
cannot achieve the asynchronous capacity in general, and that the penalty is
particularly significant in the high-rate regime.
