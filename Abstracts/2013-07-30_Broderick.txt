Title: Optimistic Concurrency Control for Distributed Unsupervised Learning
Abstract: Research on distributed machine learning algorithms has focused primarily on
one of two extremes - algorithms that obey strict concurrency constraints or
algorithms that obey few or no such constraints. We consider an intermediate
alternative in which algorithms optimistically assume that conflicts are
unlikely and if conflicts do arise a conflict-resolution protocol is invoked.
We view this "optimistic concurrency control" paradigm as particularly
appropriate for large-scale machine learning algorithms, particularly in the
unsupervised setting. We demonstrate our approach in three problem areas:
clustering, feature learning and online facility location. We evaluate our
methods via large-scale experiments in a cluster computing environment.
