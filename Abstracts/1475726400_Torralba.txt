Title: Places: An Image Database for Deep Scene Understanding
Abstract: The rise of multi-million-item dataset initiatives has enabled data-hungry
machine learning algorithms to reach near-human semantic classification at
tasks such as object and scene recognition. Here we describe the Places
Database, a repository of 10 million scene photographs, labeled with scene
semantic categories and attributes, comprising a quasi-exhaustive list of the
types of environments encountered in the world. Using state of the art
Convolutional Neural Networks, we provide impressive baseline performances at
scene classification. With its high-coverage and high-diversity of exemplars,
the Places Database offers an ecosystem to guide future progress on currently
intractable visual recognition problems.
