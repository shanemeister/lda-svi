Title: Planetary Candidates Observed by Kepler VI: Planet Sample from Q1-Q16  (47 Months)
Abstract: \We present the sixth catalog of Kepler candidate planets based on nearly 4
years of high precision photometry. This catalog builds on the legacy of
previous catalogs released by the Kepler project and includes 1493 new Kepler
Objects of Interest (KOIs) of which 554 are planet candidates, and 131 of these
candidates have best fit radii <1.5 R_earth. This brings the total number of
KOIs and planet candidates to 7305 and 4173 respectively. We suspect that many
of these new candidates at the low signal-to-noise limit may be false alarms
created by instrumental noise, and discuss our efforts to identify such
objects. We re-evaluate all previously published KOIs with orbital periods of
>50 days to provide a consistently vetted sample that can be used to improve
planet occurrence rate calculations. We discuss the performance of our planet
detection algorithms, and the consistency of our vetting products. The full
catalog is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet Archive.
