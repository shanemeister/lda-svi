Title: Network Infusion to Infer Information Sources in Networks
Abstract: Several significant models have been developed that enable the study of
diffusion of signals across biological, social and engineered networks. Within
these established frameworks, the inverse problem of identifying the source of
the propagated signal is challenging, owing to the numerous alternative
possibilities for signal progression through the network. In real world
networks, the challenge of determining sources is compounded as the true
propagation dynamics are typically unknown, and when they have been directly
measured, they rarely conform to the assumptions of any of the well-studied
models. In this paper we introduce a method called Network Infusion (NI) that
has been designed to circumvent these issues, making source inference practical
for large, complex real world networks. The key idea is that to infer the
source node in the network, full characterization of diffusion dynamics, in
many cases, may not be necessary. This objective is achieved by creating a
diffusion kernel that well-approximates standard diffusion models, but lends
itself to inversion, by design, via likelihood maximization or error
minimization. We apply NI for both single-source and multi-source diffusion,
for both single-snapshot and multi-snapshot observations, and for both
homogeneous and heterogeneous diffusion setups. We prove the mean-field
optimality of NI for different scenarios, and demonstrate its effectiveness
over several synthetic networks. Moreover, we apply NI to a real-data
application, identifying news sources in the Digg social network, and
demonstrate the effectiveness of NI compared to existing methods. Finally, we
propose an integrative source inference framework that combines NI with a
distance centrality-based method, which leads to a robust performance in cases
where the underlying dynamics are unknown.
