Title: Parallel Stitching of Two-Dimensional Materials
Abstract: Diverse parallel stitched two-dimensional heterostructures are synthesized,
including metal-semiconductor (graphene-MoS2), semiconductor-semiconductor
(WS2-MoS2), and insulator-semiconductor (hBN-MoS2), directly through selective
sowing of aromatic molecules as the seeds in chemical vapor deposition (CVD)
method. Our methodology enables the large-scale fabrication of lateral
heterostructures with arbitrary patterns, and clean and precisely aligned
interfaces, which offers tremendous potential for its application in integrated
circuits.
