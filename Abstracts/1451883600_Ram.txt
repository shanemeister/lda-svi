Title: Resonance-enhanced waveguide-coupled silicon-germanium detector
Abstract: A photodiode with 0.55$\pm$0.1 A/W responsivity at a wavelength of 1176.9 nm
has been fabricated in a 45 nm microelectronics silicon-on-insulator foundry
process. The resonant waveguide photodetector exploits carrier generation in
silicon-germanium (SiGe) within a microring which is compatible with
high-performance electronics. A 3 dB bandwidth of 5 GHz at -4 V bias is
obtained with a dark current of less than 20 pA.
