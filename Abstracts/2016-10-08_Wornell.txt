Title: Defect tolerance: fundamental limits and examples
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of adding redundancy to a collection of
physical objects so that the overall system is more robust to failures.
Physical redundancy can (generally) be achieved by employing copy/substitute
procedures. This is fundamentally different from information redundancy, where
a single parity check simultaneously protects a large number of data bits
against a single erasure. We propose a bipartite graph model of designing
defect-tolerant systems where defective objects are repaired by reconnecting
them to strategically placed redundant objects. The fundamental limits of this
model are characterized under various asymptotic settings and both asymptotic
and finite-size optimal systems are constructed.
Mathematically, we say that a $k$ by $m$ bipartite graph corrects $t$ defects
over an alphabet of size $q$ if for every $q$-coloring of $k$ left vertices
there exists a $q$-coloring of $m$ right vertices such that every left vertex
is connected to at least $t$ same-colored right vertices. We study the
trade-off between redundancy $m / k$ and the total number of edges in the graph
divided by $k$. The question is trivial when $q\ge k$: the optimal solution is
a simple $t$-fold replication. However, when $q<k$ non-trivial savings are
possible by leveraging the inherent repetition of colors.
