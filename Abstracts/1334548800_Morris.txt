Title: Crowdsourcing Collective Emotional Intelligence
Abstract: One of the hallmarks of emotional intelligence is the ability to regulate
emotions. Research suggests that cognitive reappraisal - a technique that
involves reinterpreting the meaning of a thought or situation - can
down-regulate negative emotions, without incurring significant psychological or
physiological costs. Habitual use of this strategy is also linked to many key
indices of physical and emotional health. Unfortunately, this technique is not
always easy to apply. Thinking flexibly about stressful thoughts and situations
requires creativity and poise, faculties that often elude us when we need them
the most. In this paper, we propose an assistive technology that coordinates
collective intelligence on demand, to help individuals reappraise stressful
thoughts and situations. In two experiments, we assess key features of our
design and we demonstrate the feasibility of crowdsourcing empathetic
reappraisals with on demand workforces, such as Amazon's Mechanical Turk.
