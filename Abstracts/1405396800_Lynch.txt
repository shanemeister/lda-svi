Title: A Coded Shared Atomic Memory Algorithm for Message Passing Architectures
Abstract: This paper considers the communication and storage costs of emulating atomic
(linearizable) multi-writer multi-reader shared memory in distributed
message-passing systems. The paper contains three main contributions: (1) We
present a atomic shared-memory emulation algorithm that we call Coded Atomic
Storage (CAS). This algorithm uses erasure coding methods. In a storage system
with $N$ servers that is resilient to $f$ server failures, we show that the
communication cost of CAS is $\frac{N}{N-2f}$. The storage cost of CAS is
unbounded. (2) We present a modification of the CAS algorithm known as CAS with
Garbage Collection (CASGC). The CASGC algorithm is parametrized by an integer
$\delta$ and has a bounded storage cost. We show that in every execution where
the number of write operations that are concurrent with a read operation is no
bigger than $\delta$, the CASGC algorithm with parameter $\delta$ satisfies
atomicity and liveness. We explicitly characterize the storage cost of CASGC,
and show that it has the same communication cost as CAS. (3) We describe an
algorithm known as the Communication Cost Optimal Atomic Storage (CCOAS)
algorithm that achieves a smaller communication cost than CAS and CASGC. In
particular, CCOAS incurs read and write communication costs of $\frac{N}{N-f}$
measured in terms of number of object values. We also discuss drawbacks of
CCOAS as compared with CAS and CASGC.
