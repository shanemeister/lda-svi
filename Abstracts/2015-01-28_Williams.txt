Title: Quadratic-Time Hardness of LCS and other Sequence Similarity Measures
Abstract: Two important similarity measures between sequences are the longest common
subsequence (LCS) and the dynamic time warping distance (DTWD). The
computations of these measures for two given sequences are central tasks in a
variety of applications. Simple dynamic programming algorithms solve these
tasks in $O(n^2)$ time, and despite an extensive amount of research, no
algorithms with significantly better worst case upper bounds are known.
In this paper, we show that an $O(n^{2-\epsilon})$ time algorithm, for some
$\epsilon>0$, for computing the LCS or the DTWD of two sequences of length $n$
over a constant size alphabet, refutes the popular Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis (SETH). Moreover, we show that computing the LCS of $k$ strings over
an alphabet of size $O(k)$ cannot be done in $O(n^{k-\epsilon})$ time, for any
$\epsilon>0$, under SETH. Finally, we also address the time complexity of
approximating the DTWD of two strings in truly subquadratic time.
