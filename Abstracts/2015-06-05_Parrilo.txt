Title: On the Convergence Rate of Incremental Aggregated Gradient Algorithms
Abstract: Motivated by applications to distributed optimization over networks and
large-scale data processing in machine learning, we analyze the deterministic
incremental aggregated gradient method for minimizing a finite sum of smooth
functions where the sum is strongly convex. This method processes the functions
one at a time in a deterministic order and incorporates a memory of previous
gradient values to accelerate convergence. Empirically it performs well in
practice; however, no theoretical analysis with explicit rate results was
previously given in the literature to our knowledge, in particular most of the
recent efforts concentrated on the randomized versions. In this paper, we show
that this deterministic algorithm has global linear convergence and
characterize the convergence rate. We also consider an aggregated method with
momentum and demonstrate its linear convergence. Our proofs rely on a careful
choice of a Lyapunov function that offers insight into the algorithm's behavior
and simplifies the proofs considerably.
