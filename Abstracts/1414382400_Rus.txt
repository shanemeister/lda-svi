Title: In-Network Distributed Solar Current Prediction
Abstract: Long-term sensor network deployments demand careful power management. While
managing power requires understanding the amount of energy harvestable from the
local environment, current solar prediction methods rely only on recent local
history, which makes them susceptible to high variability. In this paper, we
present a model and algorithms for distributed solar current prediction, based
on multiple linear regression to predict future solar current based on local,
in-situ climatic and solar measurements. These algorithms leverage spatial
information from neighbors and adapt to the changing local conditions not
captured by global climatic information. We implement these algorithms on our
Fleck platform and run a 7-week-long experiment validating our work. In
analyzing our results from this experiment, we determined that computing our
model requires an increased energy expenditure of 4.5mJ over simpler models (on
the order of 10^{-7}% of the harvested energy) to gain a prediction improvement
of 39.7%.
