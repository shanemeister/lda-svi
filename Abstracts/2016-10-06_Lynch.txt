Title: Computational Tradeoffs in Biological Neural Networks: Self-Stabilizing  Winner-Take-All Networks
Abstract: We initiate a line of investigation into biological neural networks from an
algorithmic perspective. We develop a simplified but biologically plausible
model for distributed computation in stochastic spiking neural networks and
study tradeoffs between computation time and network complexity in this model.
Our aim is to abstract real neural networks in a way that, while not capturing
all interesting features, preserves high-level behavior and allows us to make
biologically relevant conclusions.
In this paper, we focus on the important `winner-take-all' (WTA) problem,
which is analogous to a neural leader election unit: a network consisting of
$n$ input neurons and $n$ corresponding output neurons must converge to a state
in which a single output corresponding to a firing input (the `winner') fires,
while all other outputs remain silent. Neural circuits for WTA rely on
inhibitory neurons, which suppress the activity of competing outputs and drive
the network towards a converged state with a single firing winner. We attempt
to understand how the number of inhibitors used affects network convergence
time.
We show that it is possible to significantly outperform naive WTA
constructions through a more refined use of inhibition, solving the problem in
$O(\theta)$ rounds in expectation with just $O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ inhibitors
for any $\theta$. An alternative construction gives convergence in
$O(\log^{1/\theta} n)$ rounds with $O(\theta)$ inhibitors. We compliment these
upper bounds with our main technical contribution, a nearly matching lower
bound for networks using $\ge \log\log n$ inhibitors. Our lower bound uses
familiar indistinguishability and locality arguments from distributed computing
theory. It lets us derive a number of interesting conclusions about the
structure of any network solving WTA with good probability, and the use of
randomness and inhibition within such a network.
