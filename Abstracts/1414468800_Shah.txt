Title: Learning graphical models from the Glauber dynamics
Abstract: In this paper we consider the problem of learning undirected graphical models
from data generated according to the Glauber dynamics. The Glauber dynamics is
a Markov chain that sequentially updates individual nodes (variables) in a
graphical model and it is frequently used to sample from the stationary
distribution (to which it converges given sufficient time). Additionally, the
Glauber dynamics is a natural dynamical model in a variety of settings. This
work deviates from the standard formulation of graphical model learning in the
literature, where one assumes access to i.i.d. samples from the distribution.
Much of the research on graphical model learning has been directed towards
finding algorithms with low computational cost. As the main result of this
work, we establish that the problem of reconstructing binary pairwise graphical
models is computationally tractable when we observe the Glauber dynamics.
Specifically, we show that a binary pairwise graphical model on $p$ nodes with
maximum degree $d$ can be learned in time $f(d)p^2\log p$, for a function
$f(d)$, using nearly the information-theoretic minimum number of samples.
