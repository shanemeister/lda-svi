Title: Computing Upper and Lower Bounds on Likelihoods in Intractable Networks
Abstract: We present deterministic techniques for computing upper and lower bounds on
marginal probabilities in sigmoid and noisy-OR networks. These techniques
become useful when the size of the network (or clique size) precludes exact
computations. We illustrate the tightness of the bounds by numerical
experiments.
