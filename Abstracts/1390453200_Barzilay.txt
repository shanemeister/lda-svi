Title: Automatic Aggregation by Joint Modeling of Aspects and Values
Abstract: We present a model for aggregation of product review snippets by joint aspect
identification and sentiment analysis. Our model simultaneously identifies an
underlying set of ratable aspects presented in the reviews of a product (e.g.,
sushi and miso for a Japanese restaurant) and determines the corresponding
sentiment of each aspect. This approach directly enables discovery of
highly-rated or inconsistent aspects of a product. Our generative model admits
an efficient variational mean-field inference algorithm. It is also easily
extensible, and we describe several modifications and their effects on model
structure and inference. We test our model on two tasks, joint aspect
identification and sentiment analysis on a set of Yelp reviews and aspect
identification alone on a set of medical summaries. We evaluate the performance
of the model on aspect identification, sentiment analysis, and per-word
labeling accuracy. We demonstrate that our model outperforms applicable
baselines by a considerable margin, yielding up to 32% relative error reduction
on aspect identification and up to 20% relative error reduction on sentiment
analysis.
