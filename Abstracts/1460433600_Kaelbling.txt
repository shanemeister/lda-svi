Title: Backward-Forward Search for Manipulation Planning
Abstract: In this paper we address planning problems in high-dimensional hybrid
configuration spaces, with a particular focus on manipulation planning problems
involving many objects. We present the hybrid backward-forward (HBF) planning
algorithm that uses a backward identification of constraints to direct the
sampling of the infinite action space in a forward search from the initial
state towards a goal configuration. The resulting planner is probabilistically
complete and can effectively construct long manipulation plans requiring both
prehensile and nonprehensile actions in cluttered environments.
