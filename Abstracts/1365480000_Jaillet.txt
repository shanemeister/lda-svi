Title: Log-Quadratic Bounds for the Gaussian Q-function
Abstract: We present bounds of quadratic form for the logarithm of the Gaussian
Q-function. We also show an analytical method for deriving log-quadratic
approximations of the Q-function and give an approximation with absolute error
less than $10^{-3}$.
