Title: On Matching and Thickness in Heterogeneous Dynamic Markets
Abstract: We study dynamic matching in an infinite-horizon stochastic networked market,
in which some agents are a priori more difficult to match than others. Agents
have compatibility-based preferences and can match either bilaterally or
indirectly through chains. We study the effects matching technologies and
matching policies have on efficiency in markets with different compositions of
hard and easy-to-match agents.
First, we analyze myopic matching policies and identify a strong connection
between the market thickness and the efficiency driven by the matching
technology. We show that when hard-to-match agents join the market more
frequently than easy-to-match ones, moving from bilateral matchings to chains
significantly increases efficiency. Otherwise, the difference between matching
bilaterally or through a chain is negligible. Second, we show that the lack of
thickness cannot be compensated by non-myopic matching policies implying that
the only way to thicken the market is by attracting more agents.
