Title: The Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Semi-Markov Model
Abstract: There is much interest in the Hierarchical Dirichlet Process Hidden Markov
Model (HDP-HMM) as a natural Bayesian nonparametric extension of the
traditional HMM. However, in many settings the HDP-HMM's strict Markovian
constraints are undesirable, particularly if we wish to learn or encode
non-geometric state durations. We can extend the HDP-HMM to capture such
structure by drawing upon explicit-duration semi-Markovianity, which has been
developed in the parametric setting to allow construction of highly
interpretable models that admit natural prior information on state durations.
In this paper we introduce the explicitduration HDP-HSMM and develop posterior
sampling algorithms for efficient inference in both the direct-assignment and
weak-limit approximation settings. We demonstrate the utility of the model and
our inference methods on synthetic data as well as experiments on a speaker
diarization problem and an example of learning the patterns in Morse code.
