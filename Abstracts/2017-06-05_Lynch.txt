Title: Neuro-RAM Unit with Applications to Similarity Testing and Compression  in Spiking Neural Networks
Abstract: We study distributed algorithms implemented in a simplified but biologically
plausible model for stochastic spiking neural networks. We focus on tradeoffs
between computation time and network complexity, along with the role of
randomness in efficient neural computation.
It is widely accepted that neural computation is inherently stochastic. In
recent work, we explored how this stochasticity could be leveraged to solve the
`winner-take-all' leader election task. Here, we focus on using randomness in
neural algorithms for similarity testing and compression. In the most basic
setting, given two $n$-length patterns of firing neurons, we wish to
distinguish if the patterns are equal or $\epsilon$-far from equal.
Randomization allows us to solve this task with a very compact network, using
$O \left (\frac{\sqrt{n}\log n}{\epsilon}\right)$ auxiliary neurons, which is
sublinear in the input size. At the heart of our solution is the design of a
$t$-round neural random access memory, or indexing network, which we call a
neuro-RAM. This module can be implemented with $O(n/t)$ auxiliary neurons and
is useful in many applications beyond similarity testing.
Using a combination of Yao's minimax principle and a VC dimension-based
argument, we show that the tradeoff between runtime and network size in our
neuro-RAM is nearly optimal. Our result has several implications -- since our
neuro-RAM construction can be implemented with deterministic threshold gates,
it demonstrates that, in contrast to similarity testing, randomness does not
provide significant computational advantages for this problem. It also
establishes a separation between our networks, which spike with a sigmoidal
probability function, and well-studied but less biologically plausible
deterministic sigmoidal networks, whose gates output real number values, and
which can implement a neuro-RAM much more efficiently.
