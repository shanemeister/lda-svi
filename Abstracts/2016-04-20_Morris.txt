Title: Detection of Potential Transit Signals in 17 Quarters of Kepler Data:  Results of the Final Kepler Mission Transiting Planet Search (DR25)
Abstract: We present results of the final Kepler Data Processing Pipeline search for
transiting planet signals in the full 17-quarter primary mission data set. The
search includes a total of 198,709 stellar targets, of which 112,046 were
observed in all 17 quarters and 86,663 in fewer than 17 quarters. We report on
17,230 targets for which at least one transit signature is identified that
meets the specified detection criteria: periodicity, minimum of three observed
transit events, detection statistic (i.e., signal-to-noise ratio) in excess of
the search threshold, and passing grade on three statistical transit
consistency tests. Light curves for which a transit signal is identified are
iteratively searched for additional signatures after a limb-darkened transiting
planet model is fitted to the data and transit events are removed. The search
for additional planets adds 16,802 transit signals for a total of 34,032; this
far exceeds the number of transit signatures identified in prior pipeline runs.
There was a strategic emphasis on completeness over reliability for the final
Kepler transit search. A comparison of the transit signals against a set of
3402 well-established, high-quality Kepler Objects of Interest yields a
recovery rate of 99.8%. The high recovery rate must be weighed against a large
number of false-alarm detections. We examine characteristics of the planet
population implied by the transiting planet model fits with an emphasis on
detections that would represent small planets orbiting in the habitable zone of
their host stars.
