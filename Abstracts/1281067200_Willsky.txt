Title: Latent variable graphical model selection via convex optimization
Abstract: Suppose we observe samples of a subset of a collection of random variables.
No additional information is provided about the number of latent variables, nor
of the relationship between the latent and observed variables. Is it possible
to discover the number of latent components, and to learn a statistical model
over the entire collection of variables? We address this question in the
setting in which the latent and observed variables are jointly Gaussian, with
the conditional statistics of the observed variables conditioned on the latent
variables being specified by a graphical model. As a first step we give natural
conditions under which such latent-variable Gaussian graphical models are
identifiable given marginal statistics of only the observed variables.
Essentially these conditions require that the conditional graphical model among
the observed variables is sparse, while the effect of the latent variables is
"spread out" over most of the observed variables. Next we propose a tractable
convex program based on regularized maximum-likelihood for model selection in
this latent-variable setting; the regularizer uses both the $\ell_1$ norm and
the nuclear norm. Our modeling framework can be viewed as a combination of
dimensionality reduction (to identify latent variables) and graphical modeling
(to capture remaining statistical structure not attributable to the latent
variables), and it consistently estimates both the number of latent components
and the conditional graphical model structure among the observed variables.
These results are applicable in the high-dimensional setting in which the
number of latent/observed variables grows with the number of samples of the
observed variables. The geometric properties of the algebraic varieties of
sparse matrices and of low-rank matrices play an important role in our
analysis.
