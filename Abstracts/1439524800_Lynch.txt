Title: Computing in Additive Networks with Bounded-Information Codes
Abstract: This paper studies the theory of the additive wireless network model, in
which the received signal is abstracted as an addition of the transmitted
signals. Our central observation is that the crucial challenge for computing in
this model is not high contention, as assumed previously, but rather
guaranteeing a bounded amount of \emph{information} in each neighborhood per
round, a property that we show is achievable using a new random coding
technique.
Technically, we provide efficient algorithms for fundamental distributed
tasks in additive networks, such as solving various symmetry breaking problems,
approximating network parameters, and solving an \emph{asymmetry revealing}
problem such as computing a maximal input.
The key method used is a novel random coding technique that allows a node to
successfully decode the received information, as long as it does not contain
too many distinct values. We then design our algorithms to produce a limited
amount of information in each neighborhood in order to leverage our enriched
toolbox for computing in additive networks.
