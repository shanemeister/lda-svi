Title: Auditing Australian Senate Ballots
Abstract: We explain why the Australian Electoral Commission should perform an audit of
the paper Senate ballots against the published preference data files. We
suggest four different post-election audit methods appropriate for Australian
Senate elections. We have developed prototype code for all of them and tested
it on preference data from the 2016 election.
