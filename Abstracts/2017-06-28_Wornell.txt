Title: Sparse OFDM: A Compressive Sensing Approach to Asynchronous Neighbor  Discovery
Abstract: A novel low-complexity wireless neighbor discovery scheme, referred to as
sparse orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (sparse-OFDM) is proposed.
One area of application is the "Internet of Things" (IoT). The number of
devices is very large while every device accesses the network with a small
probability, so the number of active devices in a frame is much smaller than
the total local device population. Sparse OFDM is a one-shot transmission
scheme with low complexity, which exploits both the parallel channel access
offered by OFDM and the bursty nature of transmissions. When the transmission
delay of each device is an integer number of symbol intervals, analysis and
simulation show that sparse OFDM enables successful asynchronous neighbor
discovery using a much smaller code length than random access schemes.
