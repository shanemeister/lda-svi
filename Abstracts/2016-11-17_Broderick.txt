Title: Boosting Variational Inference
Abstract: Variational inference (VI) provides fast approximations of a Bayesian
posterior in part because it formulates posterior approximation as an
optimization problem: to find the closest distribution to the exact posterior
over some family of distributions. For practical reasons, the family of
distributions in VI is usually constrained so that it does not include the
exact posterior, even as a limit point. Thus, no matter how long VI is run, the
resulting approximation will not approach the exact posterior. We propose to
instead consider a more flexible approximating family consisting of all
possible finite mixtures of a parametric base distribution (e.g., Gaussian).
For efficient inference, we borrow ideas from gradient boosting to develop an
algorithm we call boosting variational inference (BVI). BVI iteratively
improves the current approximation by mixing it with a new component from the
base distribution family and thereby yields progressively more accurate
posterior approximations as more computing time is spent. Unlike a number of
common VI variants including mean-field VI, BVI is able to capture
multimodality, general posterior covariance, and nonstandard posterior shapes.
