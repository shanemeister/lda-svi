Title: Minimum-Cost Multicast over Coded Packet Networks
Abstract: We consider the problem of establishing minimum-cost multicast connections
over coded packet networks, i.e. packet networks where the contents of outgoing
packets are arbitrary, causal functions of the contents of received packets. We
consider both wireline and wireless packet networks as well as both static
multicast (where membership of the multicast group remains constant for the
duration of the connection) and dynamic multicast (where membership of the
multicast group changes in time, with nodes joining and leaving the group).
For static multicast, we reduce the problem to a polynomial-time solvable
optimization problem, and we present decentralized algorithms for solving it.
These algorithms, when coupled with existing decentralized schemes for
constructing network codes, yield a fully decentralized approach for achieving
minimum-cost multicast. By contrast, establishing minimum-cost static multicast
connections over routed packet networks is a very difficult problem even using
centralized computation, except in the special cases of unicast and broadcast
connections.
For dynamic multicast, we reduce the problem to a dynamic programming problem
and apply the theory of dynamic programming to suggest how it may be solved.
