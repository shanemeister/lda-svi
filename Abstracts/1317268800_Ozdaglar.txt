Title: The Reliability Value of Storage in a Volatile Environment
Abstract: This paper examines the value of storage in securing reliability of a system
with uncertain supply and demand, and supply friction. The storage is
frictionless as a supply source, but once used, it cannot be filled up
instantaneously. The focus application is a power supply network in which the
base supply and demand are assumed to match perfectly, while deviations from
the base are modeled as random shocks with stochastic arrivals. Due to
friction, the random surge shocks cannot be tracked by the main supply sources.
Storage, when available, can be used to compensate, fully or partially, for the
surge in demand or loss of supply. The problem of optimal utilization of
storage with the objective of maximizing system reliability is formulated as
minimization of the expected discounted cost of blackouts over an infinite
horizon. It is shown that when the stage cost is linear in the size of the
blackout, the optimal policy is myopic in the sense that all shocks are
compensated by storage up to the available level of storage. However, when the
stage cost is strictly convex, it may be optimal to curtail some of the demand
and allow a small current blackout in the interest of maintaining a higher
level of reserve to avoid a large blackout in the future. The value of storage
capacity in improving system's reliability, as well as the effects of the
associated optimal policies under different stage costs on the probability
distribution of blackouts are examined.
