Title: Losing Weight by Gaining Edges
Abstract: We present a new way to encode weighted sums into unweighted pairwise
constraints, obtaining the following results.
- Define the k-SUM problem to be: given n integers in [-n^2k, n^2k] are there
k which sum to zero? (It is well known that the same problem over arbitrary
integers is equivalent to the above definition, by linear-time randomized
reductions.) We prove that this definition of k-SUM remains W[1]-hard, and is
in fact W[1]-complete: k-SUM can be reduced to f(k) * n^o(1) instances of
k-Clique.
- The maximum node-weighted k-Clique and node-weighted k-dominating set
problems can be reduced to n^o(1) instances of the unweighted k-Clique and
k-dominating set problems, respectively. This implies a strong equivalence
between the time complexities of the node weighted problems and the unweighted
problems: any polynomial improvement on one would imply an improvement for the
other.
- A triangle of weight 0 in a node weighted graph with m edges can be
deterministically found in m^1.41 time.
