Title: Throughput-Smoothness Trade-offs in Multicasting of an Ordered Packet  Stream
Abstract: An increasing number of streaming applications need packets to be strictly
in-order at the receiver. This paper provides a framework for analyzing
in-order packet delivery in such applications. We consider the problem of
multicasting an ordered stream of packets to two users over independent erasure
channels with instantaneous feedback to the source. Depending upon the channel
erasures, a packet which is in-order for one user, may be redundant for the
other. Thus there is an inter-dependence between throughput and the smoothness
of in-order packet delivery to the two users. We use a Markov chain model of
packet decoding to analyze these throughput-smoothness trade-offs of the users,
and propose coding schemes that can span different points on each trade-off.
