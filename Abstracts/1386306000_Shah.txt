Title: Approximating the Stationary Probability of a Single State in a Markov  chain
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel iterative Monte Carlo method for
approximating the stationary probability of a single state of a positive
recurrent Markov chain. We utilize the characterization that the stationary
probability of a state $i$ is inversely proportional to the expected return
time of a random walk beginning at $i$. Our method obtains an
$\epsilon$-multiplicative close estimate with probability greater than $1 -
\alpha$ using at most $\tilde{O}\left(t_{\text{mix}} \ln(1/\alpha) / \pi_i
\epsilon^2 \right)$ simulated random walk steps on the Markov chain across all
iterations, where $t_{\text{mix}}$ is the standard mixing time and $\pi_i$ is
the stationary probability. In addition, the estimate at each iteration is
guaranteed to be an upper bound with high probability, and is decreasing in
expectation with the iteration count, allowing us to monitor the progress of
the algorithm and design effective termination criteria. We propose a
termination criteria which guarantees a $\epsilon (1 + 4 \ln(2)
t_{\text{mix}})$ multiplicative error performance for states with stationary
probability larger than $\Delta$, while providing an additive error for states
with stationary probability less than $\Delta \in (0,1)$. The algorithm along
with this termination criteria uses at most
$\tilde{O}\left(\frac{\ln(1/\alpha)}{\epsilon^2}
\min\left(\frac{t_{\text{mix}}}{\pi_i}, \frac{1}{\epsilon
\Delta}\right)\right)$ simulated random walk steps, which is bounded by a
constant with respect to the Markov Chain. We provide a tight analysis of our
algorithm based on a locally weighted variant of the mixing time. Our results
naturally extend for countably infinite state space Markov chains via Lyapunov
function analysis.
