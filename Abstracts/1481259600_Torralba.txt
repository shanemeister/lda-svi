Title: Following Gaze Across Views
Abstract: Following the gaze of people inside videos is an important signal for
understanding people and their actions. In this paper, we present an approach
for following gaze across views by predicting where a particular person is
looking throughout a scene. We collect VideoGaze, a new dataset which we use as
a benchmark to both train and evaluate models. Given one view with a person in
it and a second view of the scene, our model estimates a density for gaze
location in the second view. A key aspect of our approach is an end-to-end
model that solves the following sub-problems: saliency, gaze pose, and
geometric relationships between views. Although our model is supervised only
with gaze, we show that the model learns to solve these subproblems
automatically without supervision. Experiments suggest that our approach
follows gaze better than standard baselines and produces plausible results for
everyday situations.
