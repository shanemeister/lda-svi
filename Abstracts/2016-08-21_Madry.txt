Title: Computing Maximum Flow with Augmenting Electrical Flows
Abstract: We present an $\tilde{O}\left(m^{\frac{10}{7}}U^{\frac{1}{7}}\right)$-time
algorithm for the maximum $s$-$t$ flow problem and the minimum $s$-$t$ cut
problem in directed graphs with $m$ arcs and largest integer capacity $U$. This
matches the running time of the
$\tilde{O}\left((mU)^{\frac{10}{7}}\right)$-time algorithm of M\k{a}dry (FOCS
2013) in the unit-capacity case, and improves over it, as well as over the
$\tilde{O}\left(m \sqrt{n} \log U\right)$-time algorithm of Lee and Sidford
(FOCS 2014), whenever $U$ is moderately large and the graph is sufficiently
sparse. By well-known reductions, this also gives similar running time
improvements for the maximum-cardinality bipartite $b$-matching problem.
One of the advantages of our algorithm is that it is significantly simpler
than the ones presented in Madry (FOCS 2013) and Lee and Sidford (FOCS 2014).
In particular, these algorithms employ a sophisticated interior-point method
framework, while our algorithm is cast directly in the classic augmenting path
setting that almost all the combinatorial maximum flow algorithms use. At a
high level, the presented algorithm takes a primal dual approach in which each
iteration uses electrical flows computations both to find an augmenting $s$-$t$
flow in the current residual graph and to update the dual solution. We show
that by maintain certain careful coupling of these primal and dual solutions we
are always guaranteed to make significant progress.
