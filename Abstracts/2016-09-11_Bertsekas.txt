Title: Regular Policies in Abstract Dynamic Programming
Abstract: We consider challenging dynamic programming models where the associated
Bellman equation, and the value and policy iteration algorithms commonly
exhibit complex and even pathological behavior. Our analysis is based on the
new notion of regular policies. These are policies that are well-behaved with
respect to value and policy iteration, and are patterned after proper policies,
which are central in the theory of stochastic shortest path problems. We show
that the optimal cost function over regular policies may have favorable value
and policy iteration properties, which the optimal cost function over all
policies need not have. We accordingly develop a unifying methodology to
address long standing analytical and algorithmic issues in broad classes of
undiscounted models, including stochastic and minimax shortest path problems,
as well as positive cost, negative cost, risk-sensitive, and multiplicative
cost problems.
