Title: Bust-a-Move/Puzzle Bobble is NP-Complete
Abstract: We prove that the classic 1994 Taito video game, known as Puzzle Bobble or
Bust-a-Move, is NP-complete. Our proof applies to the perfect-information
version where the bubble sequence is known in advance, and it uses just three
bubble colors.
